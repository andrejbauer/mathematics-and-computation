  <strong>Is there a rigorous definition for what constitutes a rigorous
  definition?</strong>


  Thanks for A2A, HÃ©ctor. Probably not, because it's a purely colloquial and,
  actually, silly expression. I'm not a logician, so I maybe wrong but I believe
  the only basis definitions in maths are incorporated set theory and logic.
  Even numbers, be it&#8230;
