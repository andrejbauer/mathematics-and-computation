  I'm not sure I understand this. It starts with size 9 by default, I changed it
  to 3 (I body with 2 heads) to make an original hydra. If I click on one head,
  instead of making 2 extra heads grow in it's place (making it 3 heads and one
  body) like the hydra thing goes, it switches to 1 head and 1 body. Also, why
  does it have multiple bodies if you start at 9? I thought the hydra always had
  1 body, and heads never  grew heads. Very confused.
