message: "Hi,\r\n\r\nCool game.  But I think it has a bug.  You don't seem to eliminate a head attached to the root when picked, so that those \"root heads\" get replicated when you subsequently pick a non root head to eliminate.\r\n\r\nIf I have this to start:\r\n[sourcecode gutter=\"false\"]\r\nO  Y  X \r\n\\ /  /  \r\n O  /  \r\n | / \r\n O\r\n[/sourcecode]\r\nAnd eliminate the X, and then the Y, it's as if I never eliminated the X at all.\r\n\r\nOr perhaps I don't understand the game...\r\n\r\nJohn."
