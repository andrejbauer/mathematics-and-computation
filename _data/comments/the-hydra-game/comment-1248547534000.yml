message: "Hi,\n\nCool game.  But I think it has a bug.  You don't seem to eliminate a head attached to the root when picked, so that those \"root heads\" get replicated when you subsequently pick a non root head to eliminate.\n\nIf I have this to start:\n[sourcecode gutter=\"false\"]\nO  Y  X \n\\ /  /  \n O  /  \n | / \n O\n</pre>\nAnd eliminate the X, and then the Y, it's as if I never eliminated the X at all.\n\nOr perhaps I don't understand the game...\n\nJohn."
