message: "I can't get the java applet to work in Opera or Firefox, and the program didn't work as a standalone either.  (I followed the command-line instructions and got a \"class not found\" type of error.  I do have the JRE installed.)  Any chance you can help?  I'd like to use it for a talk I'm giving in two days.\n\nScott"
