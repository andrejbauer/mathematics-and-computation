  @Bo: I think it's ok. The head itself gets a 0, but because it is growing out
  of a lower node, we turn that into $\omega^0 = 1$. So, the only way to get $0$
  is to have just one head without any necks, in other words the root. For
  example, if we had one head growing out of the root we would assign $0$ to the
  head, and then $\omega^0 = 1$ to the whole thing.
