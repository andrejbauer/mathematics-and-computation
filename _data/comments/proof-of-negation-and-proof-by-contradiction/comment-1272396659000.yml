message: "I am sympathetic to saying that ordinary language \"proof by contradiction\" might as well refer to \"proof of negation\", and that it's just that classical mathematics is fraught with following this up immediately with double negation elimination (in which case, it is what was called \"proof by contradiction\" in this post).\r\n\r\nI am even sympathetic to saying that, in classical mathematics, propositions are even often considered to be syntactically identified with their double negations; sure, you can construct some formal syntax in which the two are syntactically distinct (and, indeed, this is the way we logicians normally analyze them), but just as well, you could construct a formal syntax in which they aren't, and the everyday non-logician mathematician isn't particularly concerned with formal syntax anyway. (Granted, if one is accustomed to thinking of a statement as even syntactically identical to its double negation, it becomes that much more difficult to abandon this idea when moving away from classical mathematics into the intuitionistic or what have you, but so it is when moving between different logical systems in many ways anyway...)"
