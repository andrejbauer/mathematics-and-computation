message: "It's quite possible that you're making a distinction where none exists: what classical mathematicians call \"proof by contradiction\" is exactly what constructivists call \"proof of a negation\".  The only difference is that constructivists encode this distinction in the statement of the thesis by choosing either the positive or the negative form (and considering the latter to be logically weaker than the former) whereas classical mathematicians consider positive and negative forms to be entirely interchangeable.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that one can \"refutivize\" a proof of a negative statement (turn it into a constructive refutation) just as easily as one can constructivize a classical proof by contradiction."
