  Can you say more about the planarity examples? I would naively assume that
  with good definitions the theorem must be the same. For example, I would take
  graphs to be decidable (decidable equality of vertices and edges, decidable
  neighborhood relation) and embeddings into the plane "nice" (uniformly
  continuous should do). Can't we recover the original theorem "planarity is
  equivalent to embedding `K_5` or `K_{3,3}`" under these conditions?
