  Is interesting to see that if you search in Wikipedia for "proof by
  contradiction" and see the examples, you will find exactly the one about
  $\sqrt{2}$ . And the other ones seems to be proof of negation too.


  Seeing this I'm asking myself If I know anything that really is proof by
  contradiction, in the sense that there is no translation to proof of negation.
  Or even there is something that really only can be proved using proof by
  contradiction and has been showed that  is the only way (seems to be a really
  hard thing to show).


  I know some proofs that uses LEM, but I don't see how can it be translate to a
  proof by contradiction.
