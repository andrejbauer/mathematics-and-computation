  @Zach: you have to be careful there. Intuitionistically $a \Rightarrow b$
  implies $\lnot b \Rightarrow \lnot a$, but in general the other direction does
  not hold (and in fact, if it does then we get classical logic). However, if I
  remember correctly, as soon as either $a$ or $b$ is $\lnot\lnot$-stable
  (equivalent to its double negation) then we do get $(a \Rightarrow b) \iff
  (\lnot b \Rightarrow \lnot a)$. In the case of $\lnot \phi$, which is just an
  abbreviation for $\phi \Rightarrow \bot$, we do have $\lnot\lnot$-stability of
  $\bot$, so indeed we could prove the contrapositive if we wished. But the
  contrapositive is $\lnot \bot \Rightarrow \lnot \phi$, which is just $\lnot
  \phi$ again, so we end up where we started.
