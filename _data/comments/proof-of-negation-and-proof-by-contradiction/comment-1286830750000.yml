  @Doug: even though I agree with you that the quoted passage is confused, I am
  afraid your reply is equally confused, or even more. It is clear that the
  author of the passage meant "propositional function" when he said
  "proposition". Your examples are about making the distinction between a
  sentence (a proposition without free parameters) and a proposition (with free
  parameters), or about reading sense into vague statements. But the passage is
  about neither of those.
