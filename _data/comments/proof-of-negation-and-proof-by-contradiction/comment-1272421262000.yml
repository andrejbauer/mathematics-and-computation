  (That is, I am all for calling the distinctively classical reasoning principle
  "double negation elimination" instead of "proof by contradiction", using the
  latter term instead for the "proof of negation" principle common to both
  classical and intuitionistic logic by which negation is introduced. Of course,
  in actual practice, people use the term "proof by contradiction" in a
  multitude of differing ways, hence the confusion you remark upon...)
