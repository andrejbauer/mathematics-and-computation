  @Rafael just prove a generic LEM instance without using LEM. This should be
  easy enough, since it doesn’t distract with irrelevant specifics. A
  translation of arbitrary proofs that use LEM should then be mechanic. Also,
  since we know that generic LEM instances aren‘t provable intuitionistically
  (by a perhaps not entirely trivial semantic argument), you would have a kind
  of example that is in a sense „really only provable using proof by
  contradiction“.
