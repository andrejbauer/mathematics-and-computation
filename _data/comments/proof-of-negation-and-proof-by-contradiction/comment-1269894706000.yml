  I can believe that allowing "fuzzy" graphs gets you into trouble. But I would
  say that the correct constructive definition of finite structures from
  discrete mathematics should require decidability all around (decidable
  equality, decidable relations, decidable subsets, etc). So, essentially
  discrete math can be coded into arithmetic.
