  Hi, I like how you are interested in intuitionistic and univalent
  constructions. I am wondering, however, how you constructed root 2 = a/b as
  part of your proof. There is no proof that it is correct, so you cannot use it
  as a statement, even for assumption, right? At least in univalent type theory,
  your proof could not provide the value of root 2 since there is a law of
  excluded middle used to define the irrational. At some point in evaluation you
  state that the negation of the rationals within the reals is the irrationals,
  which is not intuitionistic.
