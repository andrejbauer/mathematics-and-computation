message: "@Timothy Swan: I am not sure what bothers you, but as far as I can tell, you think that whenever I use negation then I am automatically classical. This is false. Negation is part of constructive mathematics (as well as univalent foundations). There is no \"law of excluded middle\" involved in the definition of irrationals. The irrationals are defined as the set (or type)\r\n$$\\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid \\lnot \\exists a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\,.\\, b \\neq 0 \\land x = a/b\\}.$$\r\nThere are negations in this definition but no law of excluded middle. The law of excluded middle is something that appears in proofs. It does not appear in definitions. The definition of irrational numbers is constructively valid.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we can completely avoid talking about irrational numbers: instead of saying \"$\\sqrt{2}$ is not rational\" we can say \"there is no rational number whose square equals $2$\". The proof then proceeds just as above."
