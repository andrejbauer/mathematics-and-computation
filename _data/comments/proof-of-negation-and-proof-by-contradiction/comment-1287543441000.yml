  @Andrej: Is a proof by negation valid for the intuitionist because it can
  easily be turned into a proof by contraposition? (For example, if, in trying
  to prove $\lnot\phi$, I prove $\phi\Rightarrow b$, where $\lnot b$ is known to
  be true, then I've established the contrapositive $\lnot
  b\Rightarrow\lnot\phi$, which establishes $\lnot\phi$.) In fact, is the
  formalization of such a proof actually a proof of the contrapositive, at least
  as the intuitionist requires the proof to be formalized? Playing the same game
  with proofs by contradiction (as opposed to proofs by negation) requires
  excluded middle, of course (as you say).
