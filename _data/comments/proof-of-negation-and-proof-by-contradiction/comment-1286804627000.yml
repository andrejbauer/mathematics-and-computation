message: "<blockquote>\"It is very possibly ‘wrong’ from a proof-theoretical point of view, but most classical mathematicians do not reason like this; they take a denotational and model-theoretic perspective where a proposition stands for either truth or falsity, so identifying equivalent propositions is entirely justified.\"</blockquote>\r\n\r\n     The perspective here presumes the law of the excluded middle.  This only holds on the view that all propositions of mathematics are either true or false and nothing else.  But what about propositions like \"infinite series are divergent\"?  You might wish to believe it false, since we do know of convergent infinite series.  But, the proposition, as intended by the writer or speaker, may or may not say \"*all* infinite series are divergent.\"  It might say \"most infinite series are divergent\" or it might say \"usually infinite series are divergent.\"  Or consider a proposition like \"prime numbers are odd.\"  If the writer means \"all prime numbers are odd\", then the proposition is false.  However, if the writer means \"almost all prime numbers are odd\", then the proposition is true."
