  @guest: I am not inventing anything here, this is all standard logic. Please
  consult a textbook on logic because what you are saying is wrong. Even
  classical mathematicians do not <em>identify</em> a proposition with its
  double negation, they just take them to be equivalent. And even in classical
  logic this equivalence is proved from the Law of Excluded Middle.
