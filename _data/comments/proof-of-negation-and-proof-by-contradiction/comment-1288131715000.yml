message: "<cite>\nI am pretty sure with a bit more work we could show that f attains its supremum, and in fact this must have been proved by someone constructively.\n</cite>\n\nUnfortunately not. Recall that it is not possible to prove the intermediate value theorem constructively (see page 5 of Bishop's book, the introduction section, send me a mail if you don't have the book and want me to just scan that part for you). However, a method to prove your statement can be adapted to prove the intermediate value theorem:\n\nSuppose that $f$ is a function $[0,1] \\to \\mathbb{R}$, and $f(0) < 0 < f(1)$. Let $F(x) = \\int_0^x -f(y) dy$. Use your procedure to find the $x$ in $[0,1]$ where $F$ attains its maximum. By the fundamental theorem of calculus $F$ is differentiable and $F' = -f$, and since $x$ is where $F$ has a maximum, $F'(x) = 0$, so $-f(x) = 0$, so $f(x) = 0$, and the intermediate value has been found. [End proof]\n\nTherefore no such method can exist (a proof of negation).\n\nBishop proves the necessary calculus theorems in his book. Interestingly, Bishop shows how to compute the least upper bound of a continuous function on an interval, but doesn't mention that it can't be shown to take that value."
