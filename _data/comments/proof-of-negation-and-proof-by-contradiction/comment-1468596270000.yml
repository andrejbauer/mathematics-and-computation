  I encounter the following problem: students call proof by negation (meaning
  reduction to contradiction) when in order to prove "if p then q" they prove
  that "if not q then not p". The latter uses clearly the tautology that " 'if p
  then q' iff 'if not q then not p' ". This type of proof is called
  contrapositive but students are not aware to the distinction.
