message: "The law of excluded middle is that this statement is true:\r\n\r\np or ~p\r\n\r\nBut does that law require that all statements are either true or false? Can a statement be ~true without being false?\r\n\r\nSome people would say that self referential statements are neither true nor false, but many philosophers would explain that a self referential statement is actually an argument containing more than one statement being phrased as a statement due to imprecise language. There are even those who go one step further and say that all paradoxes are just problems with imprecise language.\r\n\r\nIf mathematics is incomplete or contains any statements that are ~true, then it is possible that there are mathematical conclusions that could be ~true.\r\n\r\nYour example:\r\n\r\nP = {x in RR ; x > 0}` then `not P = {x in RR ; x < 0}\r\n\r\nContains two distinct differences from: p or ~p\r\n\r\nThe first difference is \"then\"\r\n\r\nand the second difference is ~p = x<0\r\n\r\nTo make them exactly equivalent you need to change it to read:\r\n\r\nP = {x in RR ; x > 0} or P = ~{x in RR ; x > 0}\r\n\r\nOtherwise you need to first prove:\r\n\r\n{x in RR ; x < 0} = ~{x in RR ; x > 0}\r\n\r\nAre these two statements equivalent: 1 or -1 and 1 or ~1 ?\r\n\r\nWhile the set of all real numbers includes the set of all positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero, that is not to say the same thing as the set of negative numbers is the set of all numbers that are not positive, unless you are already relying on the LEM to prove that claim. Your proof of your claim would be relying on a false premise.\r\n\r\nYour first step would be to prove that the set of all non positive numbers is the set of all negative numbers without using the LEM."
