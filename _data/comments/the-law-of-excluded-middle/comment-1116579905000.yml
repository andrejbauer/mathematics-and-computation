message: "In response to Thad, a great deal of attention in AI over the last 30 years has been on logics for defeasible reasoning -- ie, logics in which one can reach conclusions which can be subsequently defeated in the light of new information, or on the basis of further reasoning, or due to some change in the environment.  This work has led AI researchers to look at argumentation, the theories of argument and debate first developed in philosophy.   In this area, a key figure has been Aristotle, so it is nice to see his ideas finally being applied in contemporary AI.   \n\n"
