message: "\nHere's a good, practical justification for adopting a constructive approach:\n\nSuppose you've built an online marketplace, and you invite me to join it.  In response, I ask you if the market mechanism (eg, an auction or negotiation mechanism) you are using is guaranteed to reach an equilibrium state, a situation where demand and supply are equal. You respond with a statement that you have proved that an equilibrium is always achieved.  When I ask you for your proof, you present me with a non-constructive proof (eg, a proof using a fixed point theorem which itself relies on reductio ad absurdem).  Why should I accept this proof?  Well, IMO, I should not accept it.  Unless you can construct the (path which leads to the) equilibrium state, then IMO, you haven't demonstrated adequately that your system can reach it. \n\nThe same is true of any other relevant properties of the system, eg, that the mechanism is fair to all participants. \n\n"
