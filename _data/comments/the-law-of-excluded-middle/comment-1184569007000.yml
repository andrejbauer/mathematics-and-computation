message: "Hi Andrej.\n\nI once told you that my brain can handle only classical \nlogic (to which you of course disagreed). But now I have \ncome across a real-life phenomenon that I simply cannot \ngrasp; so maybe you can make non-classical sense of it.\n\nIn the old days I often used to go cycling but now, with\nfamily and kids, find it difficult to get around to it.\nSpecificially each time I want to go, my wife says: \nyou can cycle whenever you like, just not now.\n\nI tried to formalize this as the statement \n  forall t:   forall s:    ( st  P(s) ) \non the predicate P(t) := \"I can go cycling at instant t\"\nand found it (at least classically) paradoxical.\n\nSo can NON-classical logic help understanding women ?\n(Notice that, if so, this would make an ultimate selling point!)"
