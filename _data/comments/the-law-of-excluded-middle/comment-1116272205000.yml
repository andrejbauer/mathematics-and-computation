message: "Thanks, Andrej.\r\n\r\nCall your final question Q1:\r\n\r\nQ1:  \"If a program does not run forever, does it terminate?\"\r\n\r\nCertainly, if I potentially had money at stake in some online marketplace, I would want an affirmative answer to a second question:\r\n\r\nQ2(X):  \"If a program does not run forever, does it terminate within time X?\"   (eg, X = my expected lifetime). \r\n\r\nIf all you can tell me is that the answer to question Q1 is YES, but you cannot give me an answer to Q2(X), then I would not participate in your marketplace.   An answer of YES to Q1 is not necessarily an answer of YES to Q2(X).  And, for any given X, a non-constructive proof-by-contradiction of Q1=YES will provide no information on the answer of \r\nQ(X). (I believe this; it should be possible to prove it, I imagine.) \r\n\r\nA constructive proof of Q1=YES, on the other hand, may well provide information on the answer to Q2(X), at least for some values of X. \r\n\r\nFrom this I conclude that all venture capitalists should be constructivists. :-)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
