message: "Nice explaination.\r\n\r\nWhen I explain my construtivism I say that I study what is provable, while classical mathematicians study what is true.  Thus P âˆ¨ Â¬P states that either P is provable or Â¬P is provable, and every knows that isn&rsquo;t provable (it isn&rsquo;t even true).\r\n\r\nMy explaination is not incompatable with yours."
