message: "That is a good example. I would just like to point out that it is logically equivalent (on the face of it) to a simpler and well-known example in programming. Since being in equilibrium is expressed as an equation, proving that a system is in equilibrium is like proving that a certain number is zero. Now a proof by contradiction will show that it is impossible for the number to be different from zero. Can we conclude from that that the number is zero? Is it constructively the case, for `x in RR`, that `not not (x = 0) =&gt; x = 0`? (If it is impossible for a system not to be in equilibrium, must it be in equilibrium?)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a well-known question. It is usually expressed in the following form: if a sequence `a_n` of 0's and 1's is not always 0, does it contain a 1?\r\n<blockquote>\r\n`not (forall n in N. a_n = 0) =&gt; exists n in NN . a_n = 1`\r\n</blockquote>\r\nThe affirmative answer to this question is known as <em>Markov principle</em>. PeterMcB is telling us he does not believe in it. But it is very hard not to believe in it, in my opinion, when you ask it in the following form: if a program does not run forever, does it terminate? PeterMcB says \"not necessarily\".\r\n"
