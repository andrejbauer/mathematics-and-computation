  @Adrian: Bamboo paper on Mac is useless, as it can't even export the files. I
  am super-happy with Screenflow for recording screencasts.  I just record the
  whole thing, chop it up, and export the pieces to Vimeo.com. If I had to stop
  and restart the screencast all the time, that would be distracting. I find it
  absolutely crucial that the technology presents little or no overhead during
  the lecture. Wheeling in smartboards, worrying about where the camera is
  pointing or which way my head should be turned consumes too much brain power.
