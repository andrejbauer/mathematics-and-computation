message: "I should say at the outset that I've never tried a screencast of a lecture and have no intention of ever doing so, so my comments are somewhat limited in applicability.  However, I do give lectures as PDF presentations with live annotation where needed so I have some experience with the other pieces of the technology.\n\nI echo Edward's comment: I'm similarly surprised by your assessment of xournal.  That's my annotator-of-choice when I'm using a Linux computer (I use Jarnal if on Windows).  I put in a couple of UI tweaks to make the fullscreen mode a little less cluttered (isn't open-source wonderful?) but even without that, I consider it very easy to use and am pleased with the results.  My total cost for my system is thus only about 30UKP for the Wacom tablet (I got a smaller one for greater portability).  Although, as I said, I've never done a screencast of a lecture then I have done of other things and used free software and been perfectly happy with it.\n\nMy experience with MacOSX is limited, but you mention an iPad so maybe you have one of them to hand.  There are a few apps that would seem to have the functionality that you need.  \"Explain Everything\" is the one that springs first to mind.\n\nThough I have to say that it sounds more as though you want an Intelligent Whiteboard.  That's only 2 or 3 times your current cost - which is less than I was expecting."
