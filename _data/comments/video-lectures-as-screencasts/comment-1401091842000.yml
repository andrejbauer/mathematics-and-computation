  In the last years I used flash, MOODLE and camtasia for the online lectures on
  video or interactive, but I never give a lecture with my wacom intuos 4. I
  just used at home to prepare the videos and integrate them in the MOODLE
  lessons with same Flash integrated: I used sancoré also. The bugs kill this
  software.  Now I planned to use it again because it has a new version: too
  SLOW. I think its because the files became to heavy. I don't know.  It works
  well with 10 pages, but more it starts to be slow. Is it?
