  A strategy I have used to record my computability theory class last semester
  was a flip camera on a small stand.  Have it close enough to the board so that
  it is readable, and just turn it by hand to the next part of the board when I
  move.  I would of course sometimes forget to turn in time, or be outside of
  the image while explaining something.  But this certainly was easy and quick
  (I took 5 or 10 min post lecture to cut the video to the right length, and
  prepare it for uploading to vimeo).  I can recommend this, also b/c other than
  turning the camera nothing about my lectures needed to be changed.
