message: "I have been video recording my lectures for about 3 years now.  I do everything myself.  I have a Kodak Z5 video camera to recorder me as I deliver the lecture.  I also use ScreenFlow on my MacBook Pro laptop.  Depending on the room, I either use the built-n mic or in one case, I have an audio line in from the amplifier from the lapel mic the imports into my laptop (evens out my voice if I move away from the lectern).  I tend to annotate my slides with OnmiDazzle because the laser pointer doesn't show up on the video.  I would use the Kodak to also record and white board work that I do.  I would use the editor in ScreenFlow to zoom in or out of the video from the Kodak that I import into ScreenFlow.  ScreenFlow files are large, but they include my lecture slides that were projected with the LCD projector, the audio and my external video from the Kodak.\r\n\r\nI recently purchased a Wacom Bamboo that I plan on using this fall to annotate my slide rather than with my mouse; hoping I can do a better job of writing and drawing with it and OmniDazzle.  I use Keynote and my plan is to use the Keynote black screen rather than the lecture theatre whiteboards.  I select black screen while lecturing, and using coloured pens, doodle or write away, then back to the lecture slides.  This way the \"whiteboard\" work I do is sharp, clean and recorded off of my laptop (rather than recorded on the Kodak from the other end of the lecture theatre, digitally zoomed and cropped and enhanced.......).  My lectures are 90 minutes and I am looking into trying to break them up.  Despite this, I export them to a file format that plays in QuickTime (Mac/Windows), on students smartphones and on their MP3 players (eg. iPod Touch).\r\n\r\nStudents love it.\r\n\r\nHope these ideas help.\r\n\r\nScott"
