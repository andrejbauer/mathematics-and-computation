message: "I've been doing a lot of this, as you see from my blog http://explainingmaths.wordpress.com\r\nUnfortunately I use a windows tablet laptop and not a mac.\r\nFor writing on the tablet I have tried Windows Journal, PDF Annotator, Bluebeam PDF Revu, Xournal, Jarnal ...\r\nOf these, the one that currently comes closest to meeting my requirements is Bluebeam PDF Revu.\r\nIn my opinion, The Bluebeam software displays pre-prepared PDF skeleton slides better than Journal, inking and saving at PDF is higher quality than PDF Annotator, and has better facilities for inserting blank pages or squared pages (etc.) than the other alternatives I have tried. It also has some very clever options for splitting the screen, so that you can show one part of the document while annotating another part of the same document, which is quite helpful when you want to keep the statement of a theorem visible (for example).\r\nBut I don't know if there is a mac version or equivalent.\r\n   Joel"
