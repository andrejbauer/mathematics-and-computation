What I want is a graphic tablet \"with a built-in screen\".\nI think I found quite the perfect thing: Lecture Notes. Writing on the screen with the pen is very accurate and there is no problem with the handpalm.\n\nBut now how to screencast my notes? That's an unsolved problem so far.\nThere are several apps on Android (I even rooted my tablet), but most of them are too slow (frame rates of 5pics/sec.\nAnother approach is a connection between tablet and PC (Wifi or cable) and cast the screen on the PC with Camtasia Studio. But the connection seems to be too slow.\n\nWell, the tablet seems to be perfect now, but how to screencast?\nI'm going to try other approaches these days;-)\n\nDaniel"
