  @Scott: thanks for the info! In my experience students prefer longer lectures
  than many short ones (this is actually the result of a poll), something around
  30 to 45 minutes seems optimal. (I suspect they just don't know how to use the
  "couch mode" on Vimeo.) So I keep my video lectures in one piece, sometimes 90
  minutes long, but I equip them with tables of contents that allow students to
  jump directly to a particular part of the lecture. The one thing I still miss
  is a decent program for writing on screen with my Wacom Tablet. Quill for
  Android seems good, but that is for Android.
