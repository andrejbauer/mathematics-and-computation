(For some reason, the slideshow player doesn't show anything at the moment; I need to fix this).\n\nI even started writing my own note-taking application in Haskell.

Here <a href=\"https://github.com/HeinrichApfelmus/reactive-banana/tree/db0129ce15148e09b12ee1535a12e7dbfa5e959e\" rel=\"nofollow\">an early commit</a> that should display something."
