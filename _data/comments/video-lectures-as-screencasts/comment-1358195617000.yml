message: "I have been looking for something that will allow me to annotate pdf lecture notes.  The open source ones mentioned above have confounded me, as I too like something that is fairly easy to use and preferably with a familiar \"maclike\" interface.\n\nI just found the newly released Pen Journal (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pen-journal/id550418353?mt=12), which isn't perfect but does a lot of what I want.  Decent tablet support, adjustable brush size, the ability to import PDFs, and pagination.  There are a few bugs (like the eraser doesn't always get everything) but I have written to the developer to suggest a few interface changes which would make it even more useful for these kinds of things.  It is also currently free."
