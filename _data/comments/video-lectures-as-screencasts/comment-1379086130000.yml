  You really have to try the app called Curio! It's amazing. It looks really
  Apple-y and it lets you draw just as if you were drawing inside a Keynote
  presentation! It displays pen pressure as a variance in transparency or
  thickness and lets you choose any background (I guess black is best for
  lectures). It's much-much simpler than Notebook, has a fullscreen mode etc.
  There is a 25-day Trial. http://www.zengobi.com/products/curio/
