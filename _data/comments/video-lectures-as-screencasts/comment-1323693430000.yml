message: "My experience in a classroom has more recently come from using Smartboards, which may not quite suit a lecture situation.  For long sessions you should try to script the session, and have most of what you will be talking about already in Onenote or a Smartboard file. Nevertheless, you can record your lesson/lecture with Screencastomatic sofware which allows recording 15 minute sections.  Longer videos can be recorded by buying the \"pro\" version.  \r\nI have just found the Bamboo paper app which looks friendly.\r\nBets of luck.\r\nAdrian"
