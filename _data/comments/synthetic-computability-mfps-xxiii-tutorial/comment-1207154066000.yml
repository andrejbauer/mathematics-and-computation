message: "This may be a very silly question, but has the approach via synthetic computability ever led to the discovery of any new results in computability theory/recursion theory (rather than simply the organization and clarification of old knowledge)?\r\n\r\nEither way, I think it's a great idea (even The Right Idea), in much the same fashion as, say, I would now consider the approach to forcing arguments via topos theory/sheaf theory to be, in some sense, The Right Way. However, in that case, to the best of my (admittedly limited) knowledge, no previously unknown results in set theory were ever discovered via the categorical methods; merely a deeper understanding and organization of old ideas achieved. I am curious if the situation with synthetic computability is similar. [There may be some confusion in even trying to compare these; I suppose synthetic computability theory doesn't itself deal with the construction of the models in which it is to be interpreted (are there interesting models other than the effective topos?), but rather simply amounts to providing the appropriate axioms, language, and styles of reasoning with which to carry out arguments within those models]\r\n\r\nAgain, apologies if the question seems misguided in some way or if I've made any mistakes of understanding."
