message: "Your questions are right on the spot, actually. They apply quite generally to any reformulation of an old subject. It would be interesting to look at examples from history.\n\nYou asked whether there are any new results in computability using synthetic computability. First I should remark that in principle any such new results can always be proved using \"standard\" methods. This of course is quite beside the point. I am aware of three new results, but two of those are not published yet. First, I have an unpublished covering theorem for computable complete separable metric spaces (CSM) which I discovered synthetically. It states that if a countable family of closed balls of a CSM cover the space, then their interiors already cover the space. An immediate consequence of this is the BD-N principle and the KLS theorem (in general form, for all CSMs). Second, my student Davorin LeÅ¡nik and I have a synthetic proof which generalizes a result of Friedberg's, who showed that the intrinsic topology of Baire space is finer than the metric topology. We showed this already happens for other, much simpler spaces, such as the one-point compactification of the natural numbers. This is also unpublished, but is soon going to be submitted for publication. The third, published result is the one on Banach-Mazur computability, published in a <a href=\"/2004/07/27/two-constructive-embedding-extension-theorems-with-applications-to-continuity-principles-and-to-banach-mazur-computability/\" rel=\"nofollow\">joint paper</a> with Alex simpson. That one is not strictly \"synthetic\" but we certainly would never would have discovered it without first doing the \"synthetic\" (constructive) embedding theorems.\n\nYou also ask if there are other models apart from the effective topos. Yes, for example an \"effective\" topos built from oracle machines. In other words, synthetic computability relativizes throughout so that anything proved synthetically automatically holds relative to an oracle. Are there other, wildly different models? I do not know. I would expect there to be variants of realizability that validate only parts of synthetic computability."
