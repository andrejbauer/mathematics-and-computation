  @gowers: Precisely, it is almost tautologous that computable implies
  continuous when you get the representations and topologies right. This might
  be why some people think that "all functions are continuous" is a reasonable
  axiom. As always, the difference between classical and constructive math is
  not in what is true, but in what words mean. Constructive mathematicians mean
  something else by "function" than classical mathematicians do.
