  @NovaDenizen: you misunderstand what it means to inspect the digits of a
  number, or what it means to have a real number given as a sequence of digits.
  Namely, the real number is not given by an infinite sequence that is actually
  written down anywhere, but rather as an algorithm, or a black box, which
  accepts a number `n` and outputs the `n`-th digit. At no point do I manipulate
  an infinite amount of information, yet I can look at any digit I want. Of
  course, I cannot look at <em>all</em> digits in a finite time, which is sort
  of the point of the post.
