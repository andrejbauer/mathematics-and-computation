message: "I'm coming to this discussion very late. I wanted to make two comments. First, thank you for helping me to understand, at last, the sense of the apparently obviously false statement that every function is continuous. Secondly, I thought I'd just point out that I was confused by the definition you gave of a function in the post and reached my eventual understanding only after reading your answer to the first question above. I think it would be helpful to make it more explicit what computation over the real numbers means. That is, a real number is something like an oracle that tells you, for each n, what the nth digit is. A function from the reals to the reals is a computational procedure that can convert an oracle for x into an oracle for f(x). The classical function sgn is not a function in this sense because, as you point out, if x happens to be 0 then you need to know infinitely many digits of x to be sure of even the first digit of sgn(x). \r\n\r\nActually, I now see that that's not quite the right way of putting it, since then x goes to 3x wouldn't be a function. (Proof: you need to know infinitely many digits of 1/3 to know whether its image begins with 0.9 or 1.0.) So to make sure we're talking about the right topology we have to talk about knowing f(x) to arbitrary precision rather than about knowing digits.\r\n\r\nBut if you define a function to be a computable procedure that can output f(x) to arbitrary precision given x to sufficient precision, it feels almost tautologous to say that a function is continuous."
