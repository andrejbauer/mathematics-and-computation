  Hopefully last update (sorry slow on the B uptake)... not if 'number stream
  contains a 1, but f only sees a 1 only after a very large number of other
  values' (understanding B as sets of sets of N). If the Type II proof orders
  the values on the tape, I think that's cheating, if they don't, then it seems
  like there needs to be some number of 'timeouts' above which the machine says
  'not a function'. If so, they should have the same problem as non-type II
  machines on random input-value tapes.
