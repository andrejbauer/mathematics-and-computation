message: "@Jacob: your function is of course continuous as a map from the streams of digits to digits. However, this function does not represent a function between real numbers because it does not respect equality of reals. Let me call your function `f` for easier notation. Then we have `f(0.99999...) = 0` and `f(1.00000...) = 1`, however the streams of digits `0.99999...` and `1.0000...` both represent number one. One way to get around this problem is to forbid streams which end with `99999...` If we do so your function `f` will be well-defined as a map from the real numbers to digits. <em>However</em>, the topology that is induced on the reals with this representation is <em>not</em> the usual Euclidean topology but rather something that goes under the name <a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.100.990\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fine metric</a>. And in this topology `f` is continuous again!\n\nIn general, when we compute with the points of a space `X` we do not actually use the points themselves but their representations in terms od datatypes (such as streams of digits). It is important that we take as the topology of `X` the one induced by the representation, otherwise we can make any function continuous or discontinuous at will just by changing the topology of `X`."
