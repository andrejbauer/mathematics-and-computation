message: "I am not quite sure you asked what you meant to ask. To solve the Halting Problem one has to provide a <i>program</i> which does a certain thing. Such a program does not exist. The proof that the required program does not exist only uses logical principles that everybody agrees on, i.e., it is valid both intuitionistically and classically, so one would have to come up with a rather bizarre logic to invalidate the proof. Are you asking whether it is possible to change the meaning of the word \"program\" so that there will be one that solves the Halting Problem?\r\n\r\nThe Halting Problem also manifests itself in logical form as the question whether the following holds:\r\n<blockquote>\r\n`forall f : NN -> {0,1}. (forall n : NN. f n = 0) or not (forall n : NN. f n = 0)`\r\n</blockquote>\r\nTrivially, the statement holds if we use classical logic, as it is just a special case of the law of excluded middle. The statement cannot be proved in constructive logic. There are formal systems strictly weaker than classical logic in which the statement holds. All of this has little to do with what can actually be computed (with the usual understanding of the word \"program\"). I hope I am answering your question, whatever it is."
