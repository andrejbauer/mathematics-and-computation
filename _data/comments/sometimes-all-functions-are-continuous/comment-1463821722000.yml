  The theorem that there is a type I computable unbounded function on $[0,1]$
  ought to be proved in at least one of these: "Varietis of Constructive
  Mathematics" by Bridges and Richman, "Constructivism in Mathematics" by
  Troelstra and van Dalen (probably volume 1). I don't have them with me right
  now to look them up and tell you exactly where. You can also do it yourself
  once you learn about Specker sequences. Section 3.2 of <a
  href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mathematics-constructive/#RecConMat"
  rel="nofollow">Constructive mathematics</a> at the Stanford Encyclopedia of
  Philosophy also discusses the theorem briefly, but does not give a reference.
  The original theorem would have been due to someone from the Russian
  constrictivism school.


  Surprisingly, the result is not inconsistent with pointwise continuity.
