message: "I just found your site, by way of a link to this post.  Good stuff!\r\n\r\nWRT your example of sgn, here's a simpler version, with a question:\r\n\r\nsg n = if n &lt; 0 then -1 else 1\r\n\r\nFrom your argument for the continuity of sgn above, it appears that you're using a two's complement representation, scanning the bits from the \"left\" (i.e. your statement \"... the first billion of them are all zero. Then sgn(x) is either 0 or 1 ...\").\r\n\r\nI don't see how a similar argument applies to sg.  Isn't the first bit (again, in two's comp. representation) enough to distinguish negative from non-negative?"
