message: "Who are the \"experts\" in the last paragraph of the blog post? If they're students or dilettantes, the paragraph might make sense. If they're professionals, the paragraph seems quite cranky.\n\nMy 1+1=2 analogy wasn't very good. Here's a better one: a description of how to trisect an angle with a marked straightedge (correct and interesting), followed by \"this should be a lesson for the 'experts' who 'know' that trisecting angles is impossible. That's true if one just uses a compass and unmarked straightedge. However, there are other ways of doing constructions.\" The problem isn't in the construction. The problem is that you seem to think the experts don't know about it.\n\nIn your post, you said that m and timeout are not computable in PCF, and implied that this should be a lesson to \"experts\" who think that \"all reasonable models of computation are equivalent to Turing machines\". So I pointed out that they are computable by Turing machines in the specific sense of computability that's relevant to the Church-Turing thesis, which is what experts actually believe if they say they believe \"all reasonable models of computation are equivalent to Turing machines\".\n\nIt's not clear to me what you mean by type II computation. I thought type II computations had inputs and outputs which in general have no finite description, making them more general than type I computations. Unless someone shows how to actually perform such computations in the real world, they aren't relevant to the Church-Turing thesis. But you say that type II Turing machines are just another programming language, and possibly equivalent to PCF+timeout+catch, implying that they are simulatable by type I Turing machines. Either way, they aren't a counterexample to the Church-Turing thesis, and that's all that these experts actually believe."
