  Looking for more information about type II computability, I found your lecture
  notes "Realizability as the Connection between Computable and Constructive
  Mathematics", where theorem 2.1 is that there exists a computably unbounded
  type I computable function from $[0,1]_c$ to $\mathbb{R}_c$. Is there a proof
  of this anywhere? I can't find any other mention of this theorem (no other
  Google Scholar hits for "computably unbounded", for example), and it seems
  inconsistent with the result that all such functions are continuous.
