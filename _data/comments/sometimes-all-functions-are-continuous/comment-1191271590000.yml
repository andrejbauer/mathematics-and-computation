message: "Thank you very much, you have not only answered my question, but also gave me new food for thought, namely the logical form of the Halting Problem. :) Thanks!\r\n\r\n(For reference, my question was answered in \"so one would have to come up with a rather bizarre logic to invalidate the proof\". I thought that maybe there'd exist some known logic which is a) not too bizarre and b) invalidates the proof.)"
