message: "Can the proof be done by simply observing that this functional m does not preserve extensionality of functions, and hence cannot be definable in the pure lambda calculus?  Anyway, this is a nice example.\n\nI'm interested in the continuation implementation because I thought that continuations could be implemented in the pure lambda calculus.  At least they seem to be done in such a way in Haskell's Control.Monad.Cont."
