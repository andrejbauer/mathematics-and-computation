message: "Hi! In comment 4, you write: \"But this is impossible, as it would allow us to compare real numbers [...], from which we could solve the Halting Problem.\"\n\nAre there formal systems in which the Halting Problem is solvable? If so, does this have any consequences on the cited passage? (Sorry if my questions are naive or FAQs. Pointers to papers would totally suffice.)"
