message: "If you can write down a base-10 representation of a real number then it must follow that that number is rational and finite, because irrational numbers have an infinite numeric representation and it is impossible to write down an infinite string and all finite base-10 numerals represent finite rational numbers.\r\n\r\nSo if you can write a number down, I can implement a sgn function that will tell you its sign using effort at most proportional to what it took you to write the number down.\r\n\r\nIf you get to manipulate real numbers containing an unbounded amount of information, then I get to have functions that process an infinite amount of information in a finite time.  No finite tools can work with infinite bundles of information."
