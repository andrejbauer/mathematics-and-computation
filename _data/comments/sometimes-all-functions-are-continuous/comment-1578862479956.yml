  It is a fascinating idea, but it seems to me that there is an obvious flaw.
  One can only agree that all computable functions are continuous if one thinks
  that all numbers are real (which seems a bit extreme from a constructivist
  point of view). If one considers the sign function over rational numbers, then
  it is both discontinuous at 0 and computable.
