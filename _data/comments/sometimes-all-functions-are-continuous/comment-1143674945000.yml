message: "Of course not. The special thing about `\\text{sgn}(x)` is that you need to \"know\" `x` to <em>infinite</em> precision in order to produce just one bit of output. But there are many functions where, in order to compute `n` bits of output you only need to know some finite amount of input bits. For example, if we took the function `f(x) = 2x`, then in order to get `n` bits of `f(x)` correct, we need to know only the first `n+1` bits of `x`.\n\nI think we need to be careful about what \"to know `x`\" means. It makes no sense to say \"a machine <em>knows</em> the number `x`\" &mdash; a machine might be given `x` as an infinite sequence of digits on an input tape, but it does not \"know\" `x` in the sense of it being aware of `x`."
