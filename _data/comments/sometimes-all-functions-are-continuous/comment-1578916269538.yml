message: "@Lo√ØcD.: Well, I cannot explain everything in a blog post like this one, but one also has to be careful about which topology a space gets. For rational numbers, you should use the discrete topology (and then of course every computable function is continuous).\r\n\r\nWhy the discrete topology? That is a whole different story, but a quick explanation is that it's because the rational numbers have decidable equality."
