message: "Indeed, the proof that you cannot write modulus of continuity in pure `lambda`-calculus has to do with the fact that modulus seems to be non-extensional. But do you really think it is just a matter of \"observation\" that the functional `m` is necessarily non-extensional?\n\nAnd here is functional `m` with continuations. I used SML/NJ continuations. If there is a nice person who is proficient in Haskell, please rewrite it in Haskell for roconnor.\n<pre>\nopen SMLofNJ.Cont ;\nfun m f x =\n  let\n    fun search n =\n      callcc (fn k => (f (fn j => if j < n then x j else throw k (search (n+1))) ; n))\n  in\n    search 0\n  end\n</pre></pre>"
