  @Ben: if I understand you correctly your argument is: if we pick a particular
  representation (everything is represented by GÃ¶del codes) then higher-order
  functions like $m$ and <code>timeout</code> are computable by Turing machines.
  I am guessing that you think (although you did not say so explicitly) that
  this is a general phenomenon, i.e., that the model you suggest is somehow "the
  most computable". This however is not the case!


  It just so happens that $m$ and <code>timeout</code> are computable in the
  Turing machine model, but other slightly different functionals are not! For
  instance, I could ask a very similar question: <em>"Are all functions from
  Cantor space $2^\mathbb{N}$ to natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$ uniformly
  continuous?"</em> The answer again depends on the model of computation, and
  for the Turing machine model it is <b>negative</b>. In fact, there is a
  Turing-computable function from $2^\mathbb{N}$ to  $\mathbb{N}$ which is
  <i>computably</i> not uniformly continuous. But if we use some other
  representation, for instance Type II computability or domain theory, then the
  answer is positive. The various representations give <b>incomparable</b>
  models of computation at higher types. None of them is "the best", they are
  just different.
