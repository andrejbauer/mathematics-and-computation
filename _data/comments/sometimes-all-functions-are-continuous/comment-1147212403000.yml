message: "No, it is not crazy. By the same reasoning, we should all stop doing mathematics because \"most problems are unsolvable\", right? But clearly mathematics has had an enormous impact on our society (a good one). Similarly, real numbers have had an imporant value in the history of science. Without classical analysis, which is based on real numbers, physics probably would not have made the progress it did. \n\nEven if it turns out that in the future we will not use real numbers at all (I find this probable, in fact), this does not mean that today we should dismiss real numbers based on speculation by a couple of physicsts and Chaitin's fine piece of popular science writing.\n\nIf you are claiming that it is crazy to talk about computations on real numbers because somehow computation on non-computable reals is an ill-defined concept, then you are just flat out mistaken."
