  Reply to comment 15 by jn: First, I did not make an argument "for continuity"
  of sgn, but rather "against continuity". Whether your sg is continuous
  (computable) depends on <a

  rel="nofollow">how you represent real numbers</a>. Assuming a standard
  representation of reals (one in which addition is computable, for example),
  your sg is not computable and is not continuous as a map between
  representations. I do not know what "two's complement representation" is for
  real numbers (including negative ones). Please provide more detail about your
  representation. Is addition computable in your representation?
