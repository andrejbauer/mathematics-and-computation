  Your observation about "no intermediate truth values" brings up an
  unpleasantness in the standard terminology. Both of the phrases "excluded
  middle" and "tertium non datur" would, it understood literally, mean "no
  intermediate truth values."  We've been trained to understand them as meaning
  "for all truth values p, p or not p", but the literal meaning is, because of
  the negative terms "excluded" and "non", weaker than the correct meaning.
