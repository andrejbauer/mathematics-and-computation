message: "I think I mostly did not understand Marc.\r\n\r\nFirst a technical point. The formula $\\lnot \\exists p \\in \\Omega \\,.\\, (p \\neq \\top) \\land (p \\neq \\bot)$ is <em>not</em> first-order. It is written in the language of higher-order logic, as usually formulated in relation to topos theory. (If we insisted on a first-order language then we would be stuck. We could try a schema but that would not get the point across.)\r\n\r\nOf course I am saying \"it depends what you mean\"! That's the whole point of the blog post: do not forget that a formula interpreted in one model may have a totally different meaning than its interpretation in another model. It is all too easy to forget this obvious bit of logic and write a book about Skolem's pardox.\r\n\r\nAll of what I am saying applies equally well to classical first-order logic and model theory, where exactly the same phenomena occur. In fact, my last example of \"uncountable natural numbers\" takes place in a (silly) model of classical set theory.\r\n\r\nThe phrase \"internal language\" can mean two things. The less formal meaning is that it just mean \"the interpretation of the language in some model\". The more technical meaning from categorical logic is that it is the language induced by a category (say, a topos). Such a language is not \"just syntax\", for instance it has a type for every object of the category. Even \"traditional\" logicians are used to such tricks and have no qualms about adjoining uncountably many constants to a language. So I am not sure I understand your point. There is no subtext, just two interpretations of a language."
