message: "Fair enough, Andrej, but I think what Marc is getting at (and what you're implicitly using to surprise us) is: you started with what <i>looks like</i> a sentence in First Order Logic, remind us that a classicwise-similar-looking <i>looks like a formula</i> sits where logics intuitionist and classical part ways, <i>and then</i> (as you say, is puzzling) point out that the first one <i>Is Nonetheless an Intuitionistic Theorem</i>.\n\nAnd then, in the section where you first mention \"internal\" and \"external\" languages, you describe two ways of reading the formula: \"mathematicians inside [...] ask [...] 'where is it true?'\" vs. \"mathematicians outside [...] compare the open set U to the open sets X and Ã˜.\"  It sure looks like you're taking a *ternality-agnostic formula and \"evaluating\" it in the internal/external logics/languages. It looks like you're saying \"it depends what you mean by 'is'\".\n\nAt least, this is the impression one will have who is used to the classical and classically-reasonable distinctions between Languages, Theories, and Models.  And perhaps the upshot is: the \"internal language\" and \"the\" \"external language\" (perhaps also \"the forcing language\") are not \"Language\"s in the logician's sense, but languages in the more-human sense of language-with-a-subtext."
