message: "Hi,\nInteresting blog post! I am particularly interested in the possible consequences of intuitionism or constructive Mathematics on Physics.\nRiemann took an internal viewpoint to describe geometry and created Riemannian geometry. Einstein also took an internal view on space and time measurements and realised that Riemannian geometry was a perfect fit for his ideas.\nI wonder if there is something like the above \"internal viewpoint\" in logic, or in other fields of Mathematics?"
