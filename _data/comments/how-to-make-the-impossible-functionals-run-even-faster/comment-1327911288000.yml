  You're not toally off the mark, though. It is relevant to ask whether
  $\epsilon$ is extensional. Of course, if $\epsilon$ always finds the first
  witness in the lexicographic (or some other) order, then it is extensional.
  And, as you observe, given any $\epsilon$ we can always construct an
  extensioonal one. But still Martin's $\epsilon$ is extensional (because it is
  total and written in PCF), while mine is not (try applying it to XOR written
  in different orders).
