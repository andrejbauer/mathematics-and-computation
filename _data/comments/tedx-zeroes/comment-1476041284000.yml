message: "I think there might be a more natural choice for selecting polynomial coefficients as points. It actually came to me while reading through some of the answers you got on MathOverflow. I wonder if this choice would reveal anything different.\r\n\r\nAs you know you can construct polynomials of degree n simply by multiplying together a bunch of monomials with similar degrees. If you do this with generic elements you'll get:\r\n1) x - x0\r\n2) x² - (x0 + x1) x + x0 x1\r\n3) x³ - (x0 + x1 + x2) x² + (x0 x1 + x0 x2 + x1 x2) x - x0 x1 x2\r\n...\r\nNotice first of all, that the order of the linear combinations of the summed terms increase as the power decreases, so, for instance, for the 3rd degree case:\r\n\r\nr? x³ - r x² + r² x - r³\r\n\r\nBut there is more structure here: The number of terms follows the binomial coefficients.\r\nSo really it should be:\r\nx³ - 3 r x² + 3 r² x - r³\r\n\r\nSo it seems like a natural choice to me to cut off sequences by that rule:\r\nPick an r.\r\nCalculate the roots of all polynomials of order n where the ith coefficient ranges over\r\n(- binomial(n, i)*r^(n-i), binomial(n, i)*r^(n-i)).\r\n\r\nThe only thing I'm not quite sure about is what to do with polynomials where the top coefficient isn't 1. One choice might be to just let it range over (1, r) (noting that the sign change won't matter regardless; alternatively, if you want to consider roots of lower-degree polynomials, also allow for 0). Equivalently you could also just allow fractional coefficients for a given maximum choice of denominator.\r\nI'm not sure if anything more natural exists.\r\n\r\nI wonder how his might affect the picture."
