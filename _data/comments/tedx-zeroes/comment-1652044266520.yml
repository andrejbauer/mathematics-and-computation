message: "Great post and presentation! It's eight years after the publication, but I've just recently watched your presentation on YouTube and, considering the race is on, rendered my own version with polynomials of 27th degree. (:\r\n\r\n[gzipped PGM, 50 MB](http://tranzistor.sijanec.eu/z/27.pgm.gz)\r\n[gray unedited PNG, 16384 by 16384 pixels, 50 MB](http://tranzistor.sijanec.eu/z/27.png)\r\n![scaled JPEG, 100 kB](http://of.sijanec.eu/sfu/27.majhna.jpg)\r\n\r\nIt took almost one whole day, but [my C program (115 LoC)](http://git.sijanec.eu/sijanec/sola-gimb-3/src/branch/master/mat/program%C4%8Dki/ni%C4%8Dle.singlethreaded16bit.c) managed to generate the image. I also used libgsl.\r\n\r\nI tried parallelizing the algorithm, though I failed to do that, possibly due to quickly reaching the memory limit and the end of the day only having two processor cores. Perhaps I could only store half a quadrant somehow, since *at first glance* it seems as if the roots are somewhat symmetric to the unit circle and to the real and imaginary axis. This is an image of an *unwound* quadrant of the unit circle of a 27th degree polynomial (I timed this one and it took 1269 minutes of real time):\r\n\r\n[gzipped PGM, 50 MB](http://t.sijanec.eu/z/27.razvita.pgm.gz)\r\n[gray unedited PNG, 16384 by 16384 pixels, 50 MB](http://t.sijanec.eu/z/27.razvita.png)\r\n![scaled JPEG, 100 kB](http://of.sijanec.eu/sfu/27.razvita.majhna.jpg)"
