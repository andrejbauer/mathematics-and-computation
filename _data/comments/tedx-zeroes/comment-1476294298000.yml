  A Lovely Picture! But The text there explains further "the color of a point
  indicates the degree of the polynomial of which it’s a root" and "The size of
  a point decreases exponentially with the ‘complexity’ of [its minimal
  polynomial]"; which sounds like a rather different highlighting scheme than
  asking for the raw density of roots around some point.
