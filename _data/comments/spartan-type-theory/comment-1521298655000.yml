  Nice. Are any of the other talks available? Either in PDF form like here, or
  as a video or something? Just bare slides work too but I love that you
  included what you actually said along with the slides. Makes them far more
  penetrable.


  Also, I tried out Lean in the past and at least roughly got the hang of it.
  Its tutorial really helped with that. Is there anything similar for Coq? - It
  looks somewhat similar but not quite similar enough to jump right in from just
  knowing (very basic) Lean.

  Lean's tutorial was basically learning by doing style, walking you through
  super simple basic logical constructions, giving you various simple things to
  prove while introducing new syntax as it becomes necessary, first showing a
  few examples for each, which you could also modify interactively and quickly
  see how the type system responds to each change.
