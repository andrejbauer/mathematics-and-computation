  If "bells and whistles" is replaced by "smells and bells" (as in incense),
  then one would have a non-catholic type theory. There is something reminiscent
  of transubstantiation about the identity type.


  Of course one could have Austerity Type Theory, the competition to which is
  the Magic Axiom Tree type theory.
