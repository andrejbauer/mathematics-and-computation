  Maybe I'm missing some deep theoretical aspect of your post, but practically I
  see no reason why 'timeout' cannot be implemented in monad. It suffices to
  replace the definition 'data Timeout a = Ticks (Integer, a)' with 'data
  Timeout a = Ticks (Nat, a)' assuming we have some well-behaved lazy Nat
  datatype, after this change evaluation of 'c' no longer diverges. The other
  possible way to go would be analogous to Maybe or Error monads: we could check
  the number of steps performed so far in the definition of 'bind'.
