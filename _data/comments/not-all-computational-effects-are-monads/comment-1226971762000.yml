  Catch definitely breaks Haskell's purity, I am well aware of that since it
  obviously breaks beta reduction, a corner-stone of Haskell's evaluation
  strategy. Isn't the the whole point of computational effects to break purity?
  I am interested to see if you can simulate catch in terms of a monad. Is it a
  monad?
