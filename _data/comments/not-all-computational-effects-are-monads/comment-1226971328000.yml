  I conjecture that Haskell semantics are invariant under permutation of case
  statements in some sense, meaning that if all branches of a case statement A
  have the same case statement B in them then this B case statement can be
  pulled outside (and putting the same case statement A inside each branch of B)
  without changing the semantics (under some suitable set of hypotheses that
  include the assumption that the expressions being cased are not diverging). 
  Adding catch to Haskell would violate this property that I'm conjecturing (as
  your example using (+) illustrates), and hence catch cannot be defined in
  Haskell.  Therefore catch must be modelled in some way, such as with monads as
  you do.
