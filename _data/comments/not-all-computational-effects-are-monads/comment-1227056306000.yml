  What more precisely is the "challenge" you have in mind?  If it is to "break
  purity" or "breaks beta reduction", then state and non-determinism are just as
  hard as your two examples.  If it is to "express" effects as is typically done
  in Haskell, then your two examples are just as easy as state and
  non-determinism.
