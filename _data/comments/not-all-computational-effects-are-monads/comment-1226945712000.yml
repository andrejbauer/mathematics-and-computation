message: "Unfortunately, Timeout is not a valid Monad: it doesn't satisfy the monad laws.  To see this, note that the monad laws prohibit anything which counts the number of times that &gt;&gt;= is used.  For example, the first law says that you need\r\n\r\n\r\n   return x &gt;&gt;= f  ==  f x\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Timeout, if k is the number of \"ticks\" in \"f x\" then the lhs will have k+2 ticks and the rhs will have only k.  I think that you can't implement the equivalent as an arrow or a comand for the same reasons.\r\n\r\nIt might work out, however, (but not necessarily as a monad) if you only count ticks in \"primitive computations\", not in return or &gt;&gt;=."
