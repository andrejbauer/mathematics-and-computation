message: "Personally I'm happy for a massive \"assuming either no seq or totality\" statement to be added, at least when talking H98/2010 or after instance dispatch is resolved. Making the disclaimer would certainly be well worth doing, because seq really does mess things up otherwise!\n\nWe need better cultural education about the Fast And Loose assumption and/or seq, definitely. But given that much, the rest mostly drops out.  I haven't seen the categorical logic take on System F (with or without additional fix) specifically for example, but it's a lot clearer that's going to exist. And a lot of good work gets done miles away from anywhere that seq would have any utility."
