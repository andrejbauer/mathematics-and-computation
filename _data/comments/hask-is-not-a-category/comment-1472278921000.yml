  I think it should be clear from the context that I am talking about
  mathematics here, and not Internet-level hand waving. And futhermore it should
  be clear that you are misrepresenting my position about formal construction: I
  am talking about the fact that I have not seen any precise definition of Hask.
  This is a statement about humans, namely that nobody has done a piece of math.
  It is not a statement in my belief about existence of mathematical objects. So
  don't put words in my mouth.


  And regarding "evidence to the contrary", that's not how mathematics works. If
  someone says "Hask is a category" then it's their duty to prove it. Until
  then, they've got nothing.
