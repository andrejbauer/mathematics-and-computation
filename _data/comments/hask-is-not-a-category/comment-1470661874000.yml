  I rest my case. We have here (presumably) a real-world Haskeller who is
  mistaken about <code>undefined</code> and the recursive types in Haskell. I
  will blame this on the pseudo-math that form a cloud of confusion around
  Haskell. One can get only so far by learning a mathy language such as Haskell
  by osmosis, and after that there's some math awaiting. (And that's a good
  thing. Engineers in other areas also need to learn some Real Math.)
