message: "\"undefined\" in haskell is not at all like undefined behavior in C. The meaning of a program that uses bottom is not undefined—its meaning is precisely defined by Haskell's denotational semantics (assuming you are using just the fragment of haskell which actually does have a denotational semantics).\r\n\r\nIn Haskell, by the way, the so-called \"algebraic data types\" do not behave in the way you suggest. Some explain this by saying that Haskell doesn't actually have algebraic data types; others say that it does have them, but then just conveniently redefine the term. To me, it's six of one, half a dozen of the other.\r\n\r\nMy opinion—if you're going to code in a partial (and lazy!) language, you had better begin thinking about cpos! (Alternatively, someone could write down an operational semantics for Haskell, but to my knowledge, this has not actually been done systematically.)\r\n\r\nRegarding whether the \"official semantics\" correspond to how Haskell developers think about their code in practice, investigating this may lead to a number of common errors which Haskell developers are routinely committing..."
