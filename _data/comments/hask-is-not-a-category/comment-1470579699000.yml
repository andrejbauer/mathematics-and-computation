message: "Andrej, I wonder if you have read Dan Piponi's \"What Category do Haskell Types and Functions Live in?\" (http://blog.sigfpe.com/2009/10/what-category-do-haskell-types-and.html)?  In no way does it invalidate your points (it supports them), but he argues (and I agree) that asking whether Haskell types and functions form a purported category \"Hask\" is not really the right question.  Rather the better question to ask is what *class* of categories can be modelled by the fragment of the language in which a given program is written.  Quoting Piponi:\n\nHaskell (and various subsets and extensions) is essentially a way to give semantics to internal languages for various classes of category. However complicated and messy those semantics might get on a real world computer, the language itself is a thing of beauty and more general than might appear at first.\n"
