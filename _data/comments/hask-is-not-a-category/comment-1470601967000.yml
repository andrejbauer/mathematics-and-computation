  I think we're in agreement then.


  Can I please ask everyone to refrain from politics and real life (because it's
  my blog). I'd like to steer the discussion towards getting an actual syntactic
  category out of Haskell (without <code>seq</code> if need be), just to see if
  it has any use that $\omega$CPO does not. Alan Jeffrey's and John Launchbury's
  papers seem handy. Launchbury proves adequacy so that should give a good
  relationship between the allgeed syntactic category and the $\omega$CPOs.
