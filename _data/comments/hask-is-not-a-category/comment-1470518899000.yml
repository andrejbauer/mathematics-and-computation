message: "I thought it had been resolved years ago that Hask was not a real category?\r\n\r\nI was a great disappointment to me when, after years of study, I realized that CT was broken for Turing complete systems: since it is undecidable in general whether certain arrows exist, you end up having to restrict yourself to either strongly-normalizing systems or \"magic\" systems, like Set, that pretend to allow you to see to the end of infinity."
