message: "I had missed this comment, sorry for the messages on Twitter.\n\nThe Wiki appears to talk about syntax *because* Haskellers aren't taught to distinguish it from semantics. They write fmap id = id exactly like people writing 1 + 2 = 3, and do the same when they use equational reasoning, which uses denotational equality and ignores syntactic equality altogether.\n\nIndeed, there's no quotienting of programs in sight on the Wiki yet they talk about unicity of functions. And Haskell blog posts do use bottom and equational reasoning and collapse syntax and semantics.\n\nOf course I agree about the sloppiness, and probably Haskellers should understand the distinction between syntax and semantics. And probably understand they're not doing real proofs.* But that is a different point. And in fact, I suspect ignoring the distinction among syntax and semantics is not so bad for the math Haskellers do (unlike the other, well-known problems with both Hask and $\\omega$CPO); they're not performing  themselves structural induction on syntax or derivations.\nOn the situation, I find Sec. 3.4 significant (and worrisome):\nhttp://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/history-of-haskell/\n&gt; Perhaps more importantly, the dynamic semantics of Haskell is cap- tured very elegantly for the average programmer through “equational reasoning”—much simpler to apply than a formal denotational or operational semantics, thanks to Haskell’s purity. [...] Equational reasoning in Haskell is part of the culture, and part of the training that every good Haskell programmer receives. As a result, there may be more proofs of correctness properties and program transformations in Haskell than any other language, despite its lack of a formally specified semantics! Such proofs usually ignore the fact that some of the basic steps used—such as ?-reduction in Haskell—would not actually preserve a fully formal semantics even if there was one, yet amazingly enough, (under the right conditions) the conclusions drawn are valid even so (Danielsson et al., 2006)!"
