  I have been told more than once, and the Haskell wiki says this explicitly,
  that "the objects of Hask are Haskell types". It does not say that the object
  are $\omega$CPOs, and the various redditors and other Haskellers certainly
  speak of it in terms of syntax. So, by my reading, this means it is syntax. I
  already stated explicitly that I am all in favor of $\omega$CPOs. If that's
  what people think they are using, then they should call the category
  "$\omega$CPO" and not "Hask". But I very much doubt that the average Haskell
  programmer knows anything about $\omega$CPOs.


  You ask why I want a syntactic category. I do not really care about Haskell,
  but syntactic models are generally useful because they capture operational
  aspects in a setting which is directly comparable to the denotational
  semantics. That is, if I have a syntactic category $S$ and I want to consider
  denotational semantics in category $C$ I may hope that $S$ is the universal
  model in $C$. This has beautiful consequences, and it's just one possible use
  of syntactic categories.


  Hask really is not a category, it is something else. In practice people use it
  to get ideas from category theory and implement them in Haskell in cool ways.
  Edward Kmett explained to me once (at about three times the speed I could
  follow) how lenses are just a bunch of category theory. That's the sort of
  thing that this broken Hask non-category is good for.
