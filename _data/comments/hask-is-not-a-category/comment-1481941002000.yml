  I know I'm really late with this reply, but do you know about middle
  Wittgenstein's mathematics
  (https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein-mathematics/)? Based on
  Andrej's description, it sounds very similar to your ideas. In short,
  Wittgenstein sees mathematics as a machine we can ask questions of (in the
  form of propositions), and whenever we prove something, we add it to the
  machine. To me, it seems a trick definition of “proposition”, but nonetheless,
  it is interesting to read about.
