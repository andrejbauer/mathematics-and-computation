  There seems to be a supposition here that a denotational semantics, which is
  not extant but never mind, constitutes a language definition.  It does not. 
  One needs to show that the semantics is adequate, for which one must have an
  operational semantics, also not in evidence.  Furthermore, equational
  reasoning is in now way sufficient for understanding programs.  The complexity
  matters as much as putative extensional correctness, and this is inherently an
  operational matter.  It is of course famous that Haskell programs have absurd
  space usage, for example, and very difficult to predict performance
  characteristics.  This is not a feature, but a bug.
