  Robert, could you elaborate on what you mean by that?

  If it's just a "programming language", than it seems to at least make it
  <em>something</em>. As far as I can tell, your main criticism is the lack of
  operational semantics?

    Or there being monads at all in Haskell. Haskell added nothing that was not already present in Algol 60, apart from bald pretension.
    It has a polymorphic type system and higher-order functions (I believe Algol 60 did not have closures). I'm not sure how to charitably interpret this statement, without concluding this is boring internet-comment flaming.
