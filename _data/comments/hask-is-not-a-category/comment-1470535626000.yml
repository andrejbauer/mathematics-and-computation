message: "To keep my comment simple: I think that this article is just pointing out the obvious. \n\nThis points much more towards a very poorly evolved pseudo-mathematical culture surrounding modern day programming language usage and design. I am assured that the biggest advocates of \"haskell being a well-designed language because well ... category theory and stuff\" are entirely disjoint from the set of people who actually have spent far too much of their lives studying category theory.\n\nAnyways, a higher degree of rigor would be nice in PL discussions. Or as you say getting \"someone who actually does some work\" to make claims formally (via a theorem and proof at least?) instead of a slide presentation. I avoid this side of \"computer science\" and \"mathematics\" quite extensively because of little things like this."
