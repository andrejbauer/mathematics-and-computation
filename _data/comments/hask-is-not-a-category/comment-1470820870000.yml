  It is usual for constructivists to call their constructivism "just being a
  mathematician". :-) It is a simple fact that people, yes, even mathematicians,
  use the language by analogy, without formalizing every aspect of it. Sometimes
  it's justified, sometimes it's not, but it's human and it's pervasive. See
  https://paulhankin.github.io/Complexity/ for a cute example.
