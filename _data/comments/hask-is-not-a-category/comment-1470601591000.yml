message: "Hask is not Set. \n\nThe Haskell community isn't a unified whole. Some of us would like to have better control over `seq`, to permit more accurate categorical reasoning, but that got away from us long before I joined the community, and I don't see us ever managing to put that genie back in the bottle.\n\nIgnoring fast and loose, since you seem willing to take `seq` off the table, then I very strongly agree with you that whatever 'Hask' is, it is better thought of in ?-CPO terms than as Set!\n\nHask very obviously isn't Set -- it contains messy, difficult things like hyperfunctions, it has no pushouts, we can't play axiom of choice games, etc.\n\nWe can go further when talking about the sins of our community. Parametricity isn't naturality. People tend to conflate `(forall a. f a -&gt; g a)` with a natural transformation from f to g, when it is something much stronger. A natural transformation is a set of morphisms that satisfy a diagram. This is one function that can be given all those types. If you replace naturality with parametricity and try to build up the rest of category theory, then limits are too weak and you can't build products from them.\n\nhttp://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2599154\n\nEven so, you can do a non-trivial amount of Hask-enriched category theory, so long as everything is done in a bicategory style, with explicit associators to handle newtypes and the inability to get things 'on the nose'.\n\nWhen doing category theory in Hask, I'm always cognizant of the shakiness of the foundations, the tediousness of the bicategory-like encoding, and the limitations of the model.\n\nThat doesn't mean I'm in a hurry to throw it all out and start over from a blank sheet of paper when large portions of category theory do apply, and when you can read almost anything from the last 70 years, simply transcribe it and get meaningful results.\n\nAs a mathematician I'm more interested in exploiting the structure that Hask does have, and using category theory as a useful tool for talking about structure from outside of that model that occasionally has pale reflections inside of it that I can turn into code."
