message: "Hi, I wrote most of that wiki page, mostly to make the point that Hask is not a Cartesian closed category. This is awkward, because people often have a CCC in mind, or at least the idea of a CCC in mind, when they write Haskell. They form intuitions about how their programs will behave based on the theory of CCCs. These intuitions sometimes turn out correct and sometimes do not, because their mental model of Hask as a CCC is not correct. Eventually they end up with an intuitive mental sense of Hask as \"approximately\" a CCC and work with that. Note that switching languages from Haskell to ML is no solution to this problem.\n\nFor most Haskell programmers, whether Hask is a mere category or not seems rather less important: it doesn't matter so much if one can come up with a category Hask, since by and large it won't be any category that Haskell programmers are thinking of with their \"Functor\" and \"Monad\" classes if they are even thinking of a specific category.\n\nPossibly there really is some CCC that programmers can sometimes usefully think with, together with a mapping from morphisms to pieces of text that the Haskell compiler will accept; I don't know. That at least seems to me a more promising avenue for making the bothersome hand-waving go away."
