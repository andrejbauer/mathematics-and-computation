  I already commented on the Fast & Loose paper in my blog post, but perhaps I
  was not explicit enough. Haskell people offer that paper as the universal
  solution to any mathematical objection. The paper does <emph>not</emph> define
  a syntactic category out of Haskell. It uses PER models on domains as a
  semantic model. It does not address the question I am asking here.
