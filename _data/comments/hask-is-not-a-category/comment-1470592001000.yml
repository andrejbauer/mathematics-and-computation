  To all: I updated the blog post with "Supplemental II" to steer the
  discsussion into more useful (mathematical) waters. I am not interested in
  "fast & loose is useful" and "in practice it does not matter", I know that
  already. I am interested in (1) making sure people are not lied to,
  mathematically speaking, and (2) finding a good solution (which I think
  already exists and is called denotational semantics).
