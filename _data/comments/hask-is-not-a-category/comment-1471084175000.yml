  Your definition is incomplete. When you say "<code>g x</code> and <code>g
  y</code> either both yield <code>()</code> or both diverge" you have to define
  what it means to "yield <code>()</code>" and what it means to "diverge". That
  is, you need to provide an operational account of the language.


  As for "only <code>seq</code> breaks Hask": sure, if you can give an
  operational account of Haskell without <code>seq</code> that makes things
  work, that will already be something (btw, see the references in "Supplemental
  III" to get an idea of what it takes to provide an operational semantics of
  Haskell).
