message: "@Andrej: “It is not that hard to learn a bit of domain theory.”\n\nI've bought Stoy's book on denotational semantics, and, while it's certainly enlightening, it's not an easy read (for a non-mathematician like me). It takes Stoy some 30 pages (!) to set up the necessary order/lattice theory, and explain the intuitions that guide his definitions, until he can finally provide a definition of “domain”."
