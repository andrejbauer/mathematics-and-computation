message: "Eduardoâ€”Cheers for switching to SML! I did this years ago as well once I got completely fed up with the Haskell language and the pseudo-mathematical shroud which its followers have cloaked round it. Life is much more fun on that side of things...\n\n(But I think you are mistaken about how bottoms work in Haskell, and how Haskell's semantics would work assuming it had any.)"
