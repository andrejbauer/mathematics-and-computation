  This is precisely what I am arguing against. Hand-waving and referring to the
  "fast & loose" paper as a solution to every mathematical hole. It is
  dangerous, it is dishonest, and it is doing a huge disservice to the
  community. People walk away from Haskell thinking they know some category
  theory where in fact they have not even seen a category yet.


  There <emph>is</emph> a perfectly good categorical treatment of Haskell in
  terms of denotational semantics. It uses (a suitable version of)
  $\omega$-CPOs. It explains exactly what's going on. It clears up
  misunderstanding about products and monads, and all the other stuff, by
  showing how we need to argue with <emph>inequalities</emph> instead of
  equalities, etc. But this is not Hask. There is no Hask and people should not
  be told there is one. It is not that hard to learn a bit of domain theory.


  By the way, I am quite happy to ignore <code>seq</code>, but I am not willing
  to ignore general recursion because you cannot write any program in Haskell
  without it.
