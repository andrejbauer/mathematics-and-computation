message: "With my applied-category-theorist's hat on, I am motivated to ask: if Hask isn't a category, then what is it?  Category theory isn't just about categories.  If identities are the problem, is Hask a semicategory?  If there is more than one way to say what we mean by two morphisms being equal, is it some kind of enriched category?  Can we describe axiomatically what a \"category with a seq operator\" looks like?\n\nPS. Andrej, as far as I can see there is no threading of comments on your blog, so without an @address it is very hard for me to guess who you are responding to in each comment.  Is there some way to turn threading on?"
