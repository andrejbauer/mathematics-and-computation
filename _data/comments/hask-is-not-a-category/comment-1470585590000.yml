  Hmm, re-reading my comment above, I would like to make one qualification that
  laziness is not the entire source of the problem; it interacts with it though.
  The presence of 'seq' (which is not even properly accounted for in Haskell's
  supposed denotational semantics) is what really gums up the works, I think.
