  @Anonymous Coward: you'd be glad to hear that there are plenty of people in
  the PL research community who hold a very high standard of mathematics, many
  of them even higher than mathematicians themselves because they routinely
  formalize their theorems with proof assistants. The "PL community" that one
  meets on reddit is more like the community you find in a beer bar after a long
  PL conference day.
