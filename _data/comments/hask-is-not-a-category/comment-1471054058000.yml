message: "A definition for x=y is easy. It just means for every g::T-&gt;(), g x and g y either both yield () or both diverge. I leave it as an exercise to the reader to show that this is an equivalence relation.\r\n\r\nAlso, technically only GHCs implementation of seq breaks Hack. seq (undefined . id) 7 should be undefined, but GHC can't prove undefined . id = undefined."
