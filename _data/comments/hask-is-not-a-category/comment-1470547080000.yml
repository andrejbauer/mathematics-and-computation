  As I understand it, you don't even need to work in a terminating subset to
  have a category (albeit without all the niceities like straightforward
  categorical products that one might like). You just need to be in "the subset
  that doesn't include seq". And that's what we all pretend, since we all know
  that seq absent a typeclass constraint is bad and wrong and should never have
  been added since it generally breaks eta and messes up everything.
