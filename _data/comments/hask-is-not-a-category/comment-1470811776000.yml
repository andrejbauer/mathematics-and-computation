  Well, first of all, thanks for writing the page! If I could suggest an
  improvement, it would be that you should be clear as to whether Hask is
  supposed to be syntactic (made of types) or semantic (made of domains). You
  probably do not want to get into explanations of what "domains" and
  "$\omega$CPOs" are, so perhaps you can just be a bit vague, but warn the
  reader that there are technicalities which need to be resolved for a
  water-tight definition.


  What I dislike is that on the wiki page it says explicitly "Hask is a
  category" but then in the comments here I read "for most Haskell programmers,
  whether Hask is a mere category or not seems rather less important: it doesnâ€™t
  matter so much if one can come up with a category Hask". Well then, since you
  do not have a category and it does not matter whether you have a category, say
  out loud that you are <em>pretending</em> to have one.
