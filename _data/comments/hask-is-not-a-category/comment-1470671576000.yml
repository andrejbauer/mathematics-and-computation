message: "I don't see what the harm is in assuming less behavior is defined than it actually is. A semantics that tells me “bottom is a value” is only telling me that Haskell can't express basic things like the set of all integers, or the set of all lists whose element type is some other given set. But I *really* need those things in my day-to-day programming!\n\nI think of treating defined behavior as undefined, as not too different from removing axioms from a theory: I don't risk proving any “wrong” theorems (not provable in the old theory) if I do so. It's a-whole-nother matter if I start looking at models (possible implementations), of course..."
