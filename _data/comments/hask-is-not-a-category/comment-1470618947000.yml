message: "What brand of constructivism is this? Regardless of whether it is possible to do actual mathematics in it (which Andrej brings up), what you are describing is completely foreign to the three main branches of constructive mathematics: Brouwer's school, Markov's school and Bishop's school.\n\nFeel free to follow up with me on this topic, but not on poor Andrej's blog comments."
