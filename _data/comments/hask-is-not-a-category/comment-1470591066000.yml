  I may have met you online before, I think. I would not call your ideas
  "stricter brand of constructivism" because it goes a bit too far for
  constructivist. For instance, you do not even believe in first-order logic and
  natural numbers because that automatically creates non-decidable formulas. So,
  before you do anything else, you have to argue that your position is actually
  sustainable and that you can do basic mathematics. But I do not want an
  off-topic discussion about this here.
