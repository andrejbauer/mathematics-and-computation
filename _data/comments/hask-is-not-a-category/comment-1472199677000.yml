Iâ€™d delighted to be wrong, but I have not seen a complete construction of such a category yet.\r\n\r\nseems to strongly suggest you _are_ a man who strongly believes the object doesn't exist until formally constructed. \r\n\r\nOf course _there is Hask_, in the sense people you quote are talking. We don't actually know whether it can be modelled in some precise mathematics, but so far we haven't seen strong evidence to the contrary. And even if it can, it is perfectly possible it can do in many individually interesting but mutually incompatible ways - similarly to the reals in your linked post."
