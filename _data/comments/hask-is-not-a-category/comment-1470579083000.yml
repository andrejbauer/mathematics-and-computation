message: "`seq` and the liftedness of products breaks the nice abstraction, yes.\n\nDan Piponi wrote up this already-by-then folklore result in 2009.\n\nhttp://blog.sigfpe.com/2009/10/what-category-do-haskell-types-and.html\n\nThat said, in practice, getting by with \"fast and loose reasoning\" and pretending that these extra issues don't exist is sufficient for the identities we can borrow from category theory to be useful.\n\nhttps://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/jeremy.gibbons/publications/fast+loose.pdf\n\nIf your program terminates under both semantics, then working in the simplified seq-less world is vastly easier.\n\nSo while Hask isn't a category once you include `seq` in the language, and (,) isn't a categorical product, because `_|_ /= (_|_ , _|_ )`, the view is \"morally correct\" to borrow the terminology from that latter paper.\n\nCategory theory is a powerful enough substrate that even doing it wrongly adds a lot of utility."
