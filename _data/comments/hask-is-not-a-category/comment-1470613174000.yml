message: "But then your “official semantics” would disagree with how Haskellers actually think about their code in practice. No worse sin can a programming language's semantics commit. I don't think anyone would realistically want to write programs thinking of all types as ?-CPOs or whatever. That's fine for types inhabited by computations, like functions or objects. But the beauty of algebraic data types is that its values are precisely those given by the cases, without the pesky addendum “or bottom”.\n\nWhen I program in Haskell, what I actually do in practice is treat bottom as undefined behavior in the C sense. Since Haskell implementors are more reasonable people than C implementors, I trust them not to do things like eat all my data when the meaning of my program is undefined. Just like I trust Java implementors not to eat all my data when I use a null reference. But that doesn't detract from the fact that, for my actual purposes, the meaning of the program is remains undefined."
