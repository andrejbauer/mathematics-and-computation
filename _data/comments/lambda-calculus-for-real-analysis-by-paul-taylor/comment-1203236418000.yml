message: "You are a bit rash in concluding my philosophical stand on the nature of mathematics from the word \"are\", especially since this particular \"are\" appears in a sentence which does not express my opinion. It only explains that there are many other works, apart from the one you cited, which deal with the idea that spaces are more than just collections of point. Ooops, I said it again. I am doubly Platonistic now. Please read more carefully what I write.\n\nEven if I did say \"spaces are more than just collections of points\", how would that imply anything about my position about Platonism? In fact, I do say that spaces <b>are</b> more than just collections of points. But I am not a Platonist. I am just expressing my view as to what sort of mathematical objects geometry and topology are trying to (or should) capture.\n\nAs far as translating cryptic mathematical notation goes: I did look at the paper you reference. True, nothing is hiding in it behind cryptic mathematical notation. Just some old regurgitated ideas, with relevant references missing."
