  Well, the paper you reference does not seem to be written by a professional
  mathematician so it is hard to judge exactly what its mathematical contents is
  supposed to be. But yes, it is "somehow related", as are many, many other
  works dealing with the idea that spaces are more than just collections of
  points. This is a topic that was discussed by various philosophers and
  mathematicians throughout history.
