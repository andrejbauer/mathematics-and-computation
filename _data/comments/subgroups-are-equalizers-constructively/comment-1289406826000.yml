message: "@Andrej: \nThe functional-relation definition of unique choice is equivalent to <em>functions both injective and surjective are invertible</em>. When generalising a property of sets to categories, the tension between being epi and surjective is always an issue. I tend to favour epi over surjective because I find it a more elegant property. I've never really had to care until today, I must say.\n\nSo, I'm guessing that in numbered sets epi and surjective is not synonymous. I don't know what a function between numbered sets is, to be honest."
