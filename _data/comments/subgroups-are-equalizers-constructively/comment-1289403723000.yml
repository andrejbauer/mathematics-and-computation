  @Arnaud: I don't see a point in having non-constructive proofs either, but
  they seem to be circulating around. With a bit of luck this blog post will
  appear as the first hit under "subgroup equalizer". I am a bit worried that
  you phrase unique choice as "an epi-mono is iso". Usually unique choice is
  stated as "a functional relation has a choice function". By the way, in
  numbered sets not every epi-mono is iso, but Unique Choice expressed in terms
  of functional relations is valid.
