  @Arnaud: Ah yes. In a topos the internal statement "$f$ is surjective"
  corresponds to $f$ being epi. But in a topos all epis are regular. In numbered
  sets the internal statement "$f$ is surjective" corresponds to $f$ being
  <strong>regular</strong> epi. Indeed, a morphism which is both mono and
  regular epi is iso. In any case, you need to be a bit careful here since the
  usual interpretation of first-order logic in a category validates unique
  choice.
