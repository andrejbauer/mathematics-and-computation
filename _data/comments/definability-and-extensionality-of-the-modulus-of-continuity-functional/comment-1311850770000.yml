message: "Hi Andrej,\n\nIt seems that the modulus of continuity is a property of the algorithm, not the function, so why would one even expect that there is a extensional modulus of continuity functional?  Your proof shows that it doesn't exist, but it doesn't even seem plausible on the face of it that it would exist.  Or else I am confused or wrong about something."
