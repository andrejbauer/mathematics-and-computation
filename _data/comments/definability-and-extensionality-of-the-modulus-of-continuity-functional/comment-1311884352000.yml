  @Bob: you are not confused, and I do not find it surprising that you do not
  find it suprising that there is no modulus of continuity. Nevertheless,
  non-existence of an extensional modulus of continuity still deserves a proof,
  or do you think the average person in Wean Hall (or wherever you people live
  these days) could come up with a proof on the spot? Anyhow, this is just a
  first step to the thing I really want to prove, namely that a modulus of
  continuity cannot be defined in a pure functional language (PCF).
