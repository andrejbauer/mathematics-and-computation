  Nice post, Andrej. Of course, you know that the extensional modulus of uniform
  continuity of a function $(\mathbb{N} \to 2) \to \mathbb{N}$ exists and can be
  defined in PCF as shown by Berger in 1990, and depends on the function rather
  than the algorithm, where $2 = \lbrace 0,1 \rbrace$. This has been vastly
  generalized in recent years, with a complete answer of when the modulus of
  uniform continuity exists and can be defined in PCF (even without parallel
  features). I like to see what you explain in your post as simply saying that
  the modulus of continuity is not continuous. Or, more precisely, no
  extensional modulus of continuity functional can be continuous. I am looking
  forward to the second part of the post.
