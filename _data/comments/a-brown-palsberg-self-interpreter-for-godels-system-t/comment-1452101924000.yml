message: "Sorry for the double comment....\r\n\r\nHaving thought about it some more, I think some of the \"dubious\" part above may actually be false intuition. For instance, if we consider Brown-Palsberg self-interpreters, we have a function $\\mathsf{Exp}\\, ? \\to ?$ (assuming a type worthy of being called $?$ exists, which isn't true of System T, but is true of System F?, for instance). But this looks even more obviously like, \"I am consistent.\" So, there must be something about dividing the expression type up that means 'second incompleteness theorem through the lens of propositions as types' has no force over it. So that might leave open self-reducers in the same style as well.\r\n\r\nOf course, I also thought of an example of a 'total language' that, if it could self-represent (which might not be possible), would also be able to self-reduce. But it's rather different than most total languages in use (intersection types)."
