message: "I think another problem with the abusive interpreter is that there no internal evidence that it actually returns the Gödel number of the term. We don't really know if a ? × ? was created through quoting or just a random piece of data. \n\nBy the way, the same abusive interpreter was proposed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/3s93w1/a_selfinterpreter_for_fomega/cwwhn0d?context=3) before."
