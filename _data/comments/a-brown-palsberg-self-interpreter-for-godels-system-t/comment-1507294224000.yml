  The definition you give of an interpreter in your linked note would disqualify
  anything written in "finally tagless" style as actual interpreters. [Neil
  Jones had the same issue with us calling our interpreters/partial evaluators
  by those names, for the same reason.]


  But what we call an 'interpreter' in finally tagless works exactly as an
  interpreter does, observationally.


  In other words, I think your definition of what an interpreter is, is too
  narrow.
