message: "There is another source for this, \"common knowledge,\" I think, which is that when people say, \"self-interpreter,\" they mean what the Brown-Palsberg paper calls a, \"self-reducer,\" which they have not defined. This requires encoding types $\\mathsf{Exp}\\,t$ and reduction functions $\\mathsf{norm}_t : \\mathsf{Exp}\\,t \\to \\mathsf{Exp}\\, t$, where each reduction function is required to yield encodings of a beta normal expression that is beta equivalent to the original encoded expression. Functions of type $\\mathsf{Exp}\\, t \\to t$ are only half of a normalization-by-evaluation procedure for this.\n\nAlso, it seems unlikely that self-reduction is possible in total languages (regardless of whether you have one expression type or a family), because the functions $\\mathsf{norm}_t$ are by hypothesis terminating functions that compute normal forms for the language. So the language has demonstrated its own weak normalization, and weak normalization implies consistency of the language interpreted as a logic. So it is dubious this is possible in an actual normalizing/consistent language.\n\nI haven't read PFPL, but I wouldn't be surprised if this is the kind of thing it's talking about, and the interpreters given in these two papers don't actually qualify as, well, interpreters."
