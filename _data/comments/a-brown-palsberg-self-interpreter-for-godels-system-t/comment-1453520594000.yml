message: "Re Dan Christensen: it seems that the proof idea of McBride and of Bauer's Thm. 2.2/Cor. 2.3 are very close, even though Bauer's statement is interestingly different and the proof more elegant and general. Below are the gory details I've seen.\r\n\r\nFor instance, McBride $\\mathsf{evil}$ is  Bauer's g, with $f = \\mathsf{succ}$ inlined. If you match up the equations by renaming the matching ingredient, McBride proves $\\mathsf{evil}\\, 666 = \\mathsf{succ} (\\mathsf{evil}\\, 666)$, that is (strictly speaking) becomes $f(u_{\\nu \\to \\tau}\\, n\\, n) = f(f(u_{\\nu \\to \\tau}\\, n\\, n))$, while Bauer uses $u_{\\nu \\to \\tau}\\, n\\, n$ directly. Of course, once the proof is complete, these are all the same number, so it's a very minor difference.\r\n\r\nCritically, the assumed setting is different: McBride uses only what Bauer would call $u_{N \\to N}: N \\to N \\to N$ (that is, $u_{\\tau}: \\nu \\to \\tau$ with $\\nu = N$ and $\\tau = N \\to N$), while Bauer is more general (you could modify his proof to give only fixpoints for types $\\tau$ where $u_\\tau$ exists, if you wanted to do this weakening)."
