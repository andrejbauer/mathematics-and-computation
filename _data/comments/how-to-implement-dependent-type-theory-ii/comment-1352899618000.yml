  Your type of values is what we had in Agdalight.  Having function spaces in
  your data type became awkward when working with meta-variables or a monadic
  evaluator.  I do not remember the exact reason why, but HOAS-values were
  abandoned; Agda 2 is back to de Bruijn indices (with a new set of drawbacks).
