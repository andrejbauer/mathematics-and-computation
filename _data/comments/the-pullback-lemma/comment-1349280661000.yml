message: "The [pasting law](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/pasting%20law) for pullbacks goes a long, long way when generalized to homotopy (type) theory. \n\nAfter we had finished the discussion of principal bundle theory \"in homotopy type theory\" (in abstract higher topos theory) [here](http://ncatlab.org/schreiber/show/Principal+%E2%88%9E-bundles+--+theory,+presentations+and+applications) a colleague came to me and said: I checked all your propositions and I noticed that you are essentially just using the pasting law/pullback lemma over and over and over again. And, yes, that's true. A whole lot folllows this way."
