message: "&gt; I think we are just arguing about the meanings of words. The fact that a particular metatheory is not very useful for proving substantive theorems about the object language without passing to a meta-meta-language does not, in my idiolect, make it itself any less meta. The fact that LF-types represent judgments of the object theory, which are not internal statements in that theory, means to me that LF must be a metatheory, even if it is a very different sort of metatheory than ZF.\n\nOK, Mike."
