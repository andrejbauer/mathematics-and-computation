message: "What you are taking for granted, and not defending, is that the relationship of LF types to object language types is the same as, or at least analogous to, the relationship of metalanguage types to object language types.\r\n\r\nIt simply doesn't seem that way to me. (And apparently not to Bob either, from his above comment.)\r\n\r\nWith judgments-as-types, the whole business is syntactic. The syntax of the object language is represented using the syntax of LF. With metatheory, you have a traditional logic, with syntax and semantics, and you represent the syntax of an object language using (metalanguage) objects whose <i>meaning</i> is just syntax. LF has nothing at all to say about meaning. For its use as a logical framework, LF terms may as well be meaningless. The whole damn language is just a fancy syntax notation.\r\n\r\n(It turns out you <i>can</i> try to ascribe a meaning to judgments-as-types representations. But it's probably not a good idea in the case of LF. Many adequate representations would not yield the intended semantics of the object logic. With extensional LF, OTOH, analytic-style representations seem to assign the right meaning to ordinary (not modal or substructural) dependent type systems with unique typing. This can be seen as a generalization of universe coding. Meanwhile, in Isabelle, a synthetic-style judgments-as-types representation into HOL can be seen as assigning a refinement-style semantics to pretty much any object language.)"
