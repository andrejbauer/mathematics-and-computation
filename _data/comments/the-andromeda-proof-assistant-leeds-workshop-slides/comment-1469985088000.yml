message: "The discussion suggests that there is confusion about what is Twelf and what is a logical framework.  In Twelf you can both build derivations in your object logic and also reason about the properties of that object logic.  We did a complete verification of the soundness of the SML type system in Twelf.  This means encoding the statics and dynamics of SML as logics, and proving meta-theorems about them using the facilities in Twelf for reasoning about logics.  Twelf makes it particularly easy to prove Pi2 properties of logics, which is quite enough for the purposes of that project.  It is not at all correct to say that Isabelle is a logical framework and that Twelf is something else.\n\nInstead of proving Pi2 sentences you can work with realizers of them.  This would be functional programming over the object logic.  That is what Delphin and Beluga are all about.  It's partly a matter of taste whether to prefer a relational formulation or a functional formulation of the metatheory.  We've found Twelf quite adequate for many large-scale purposes (30K lines of code to do the verification mentioned)."
