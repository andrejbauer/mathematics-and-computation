message: "Hmm, I think I see your point, but I still regard it as some kind of metalanguage.\r\n\r\nI don't think there is anything to \"defend\" about why the relationship of LF types to object language types is analogous to that in other metalanguages: it's literally the same, you have an LF-type that represents each judgment, just as when describing the syntax of type theory as an initial algebra for a many-sorted algebraic theory in ZF you would have a ZF-set of derivation trees for each judgment.\r\n\r\nI think that your point is not about the relationship between types; it's about the fact that when we describe the object language in LF using HOAS, the reason that that description is correct is a meta-theorem involving the weakness of LF (e.g. no inductive types); whereas in the case of ZF we can prove the correctness of that representation internally to ZF.\r\n\r\nSo I agree, there is something different about it, but I also think it's reasonable to consider it as a (different sort of) metatheory."
