message: "Here's what I'm thinking. When building object language contexts on the way down. It's like the metalanguage has an extra/enriched stack for bound variables in the object language term currently under construction. (Think of Ltac.) When the bound variables are metalanguage values, you have to worry about them escaping the extent (stack frame) in which their binder is still around.\n\nOne kind of solution would be to somehow prevent escape. You solution was instead more like giving up the stack discipline for binders, and using a more heap-like discipline so that validity of a bound variable is not tied to a particular metalanguage extent."
