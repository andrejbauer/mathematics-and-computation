message: "&gt; What you are taking for granted, and not defending...\n\nOops. I was replying to Mike, when he said:\n\n&gt; LF totally does work with the syntax of the object language. When we define STLC inside Twelf like <a href=\"http://twelf.org/wiki/Proving_metatheorems:Representing_the_syntax_of_the_STLC\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, we are describing the syntax of STLC, with things like application and abstraction, using LF as the metalanguage.\n\nand\n\n&gt; ...but LF is still the metalanguage used to define the object language; the point is just when we write “arrow : tp -&gt; tp -&gt; tp”, the arrow “-&gt;” of LF is one level higher than (and, in particular, different from) the “arrow” of STLC."
