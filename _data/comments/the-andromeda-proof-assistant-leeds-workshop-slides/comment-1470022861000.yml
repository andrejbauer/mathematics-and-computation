message: "&gt; I donâ€™t see how judgments-as-types could be anything but using LF as a metatheory to describe an object theory. Judgments are not types inside the object theory, so if they are LF types then LF must be the metatheory.\r\n\r\nFor me, a metalanguage must be used to work with the syntax of the object language. In Twelf, LF doesn't do this; the totality checker (the thing for proving metatheorems) essentially ends up doing this, in a logic programmy sort of way. The syntax of LF itself--extended with some signature--is manipulated. There are only two levels, LF is the lower level, and assuming a signature in LF is no more meta than assuming axioms in Coq. The original object language (as opposed to the LF representation) is not formally involved."
