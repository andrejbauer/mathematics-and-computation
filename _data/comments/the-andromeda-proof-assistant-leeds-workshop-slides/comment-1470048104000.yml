  LF totally does work with the syntax of the object language.  When we define
  STLC inside Twelf like <a
  href="http://twelf.org/wiki/Proving_metatheorems:Representing_the_syntax_of_the_STLC"
  rel="nofollow">here</a>, we are describing the syntax of STLC, with things
  like application and abstraction, using LF as the metalanguage.  We could do
  the same thing in Coq.  It's true that we don't state theorems <i>about</i>
  the object language inside LF, and that the meta-meta-language of % commands
  proves things about the object language <i>by</i> proving things about the
  metalanguage LF, but LF is still the metalanguage used to define the object
  language; the point is just when we write "arrow : tp -&gt; tp -&gt; tp", the
  arrow "-&gt;" of LF is one level higher than (and, in particular, different
  from) the "arrow" of STLC.
