  Nice, thanks!  I wonder if you could say anything about how Andromeda compares
  to a system like Twelf, which also has both a meta-level and an object-level? 
  I guess Andromeda's meta-level is general-recursive and simply typed whereas
  Twelf's is terminating and dependently typed, and Andromeda's object-level has
  certain primitives built-in whereas Twelf has the flexibility to represent
  essentially any object theory.  Are there other similarities or differences?
