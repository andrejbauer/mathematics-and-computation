  @Mike: Peter Aczel asked a similar question, and I think it's a very good one.
  As far as I can tell, once we remove the "Type in Type" hackery, we'll get
  something like "LF with equality". Your comparison is not quite right.
  Andromeda's object-level is strictly more expressive than LF. You can
  represent essentially any object theory in it, together with desired
  judgmental equalities, which is not doable in LF. The meta-level of Twelf is
  very rudimentary (it's the stuff you write with the % sign in front), whereas
  Andromeda's is a general-purpose programming language. So perhaps one way to
  characterize Andromeda would be "LF with object-level judgmental equalities +
  general-purpose ML"
