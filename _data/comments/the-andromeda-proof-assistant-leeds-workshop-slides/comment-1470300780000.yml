message: "Yes, I meant \"essentially any object theory with Pi and equality\". If you want a weaker theory you'd have to prove conservativity of Pi and equality over it.\r\n\r\nIn an LCF-style prover you get a general-purpose programming language. You can implement Tetris in it if you wish. The language allows you to implement all sorts of tactics and procedures etc. You can (presumably) even implement an interactive mode.\r\nOnce basic facilities are implemented, you can use the system like a traditional proof assistant. But at every point you can go back and tweak things or add another low-level facility.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you can look at some examples and ask questions about them. Here's a <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/andrejbauer/723aa10d90dc63a7ce0d07f0685c7a8b\" rel=\"nofollow\">small example</a> that can start a discussion (to discuss the example specifically, please use the Gist interface)."
