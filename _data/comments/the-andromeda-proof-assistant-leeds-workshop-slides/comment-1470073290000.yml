message: "Gosh, I go away for a couple of days an there are a dozen comments.\n\nI think Andromeda cannot be used to prove meta-theorems about SML the way Twelf does. Or to put it differently, perhaps it can if someone writes AML code which essentially does what Twelf does, but correctness of such a prover would depend on the user not assuming certain things. I need to think about this.\n\nWe really are going back to LCF-style here. There's a base theory which the user may extend with a signature (a bunch of constants) and then can write programs that compute judgments. That's all there is, really. When I said that the system would be like LF, I meant to say that the base theory (Pi's and equality types) would look a bit like LF's kinds and families."
