  Sometimes people draw a distinction between logical frameworks and metalogical
  frameworks. I don't get the terminology, but the idea is that logical
  frameworks are for specifying then *using* logics, whereas metalogical
  frameworks are for specifying then *studying* logics. Twelf is primarily
  intended as a metalogical framework. Isabelle seems to be the main logical
  framework. Andromeda seems more like a logical framework than a metalogical
  framework, so it might make more sense to compare it to Isabelle. (I need to
  learn Isabelle.)
