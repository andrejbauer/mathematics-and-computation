message: "&gt; I think Andromeda cannot be used to prove meta-theorems about SML the way Twelf does. Or to put it differently, perhaps it can if someone writes AML code which essentially does what Twelf does, but correctness of such a prover would depend on the user not assuming certain things.\n\nIt seems that way to me too.\n\n&gt; I need to think about this.\n\nHere's an idea I had at some point, if you're going that way. Twelf-style metatheorem proving seems like it needs a dramatic overhaul to do more impressive metatheory, like normalization, logical relations, and semantics.\n\nBut, step 1, you can assume another signature to be used as a richer metalanguage. Step 2, you represent the object language in (the representation of) the metalanguage, in some appropriate way. Step 3, you prove the metatheorem in the new metalanguage.\n\nBut how do you know the object language representation in the new metalanguage agrees with the original representation you want to use? Step 4: use a Twelf-style metatheorem to formally establish the adequacy of one representation w.r.t. the other!\n\nStep 2 becomes much easier if the logical framework has support for quoting. (In regular LF it wouldn't be needed, but in extensional LF, we need a way to suppress the equations, to get back to syntactic equality.)"
