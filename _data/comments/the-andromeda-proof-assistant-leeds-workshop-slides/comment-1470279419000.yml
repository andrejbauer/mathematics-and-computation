message: "I think we are just arguing about the meanings of words.  The fact that a particular metatheory is not very useful for proving substantive theorems about the object language without passing to a meta-meta-language does not, in my idiolect, make it itself any less meta.  The fact that LF-types represent judgments of the object theory, which are not internal statements <i>in</i> that theory, means to me that LF must be a metatheory, even if it is a very different sort of metatheory than ZF.\n\nI also think there's not much point to continuing the discussion about LF.  What I <i>would</i> like to understand is exactly how Andromeda works.  I think I have a better sense for that now, but it would help if Andrej could clarify a couple of things: when you said \"essentially any object theory\", did you mean \"essentially any object theory with Pi and equality types\"?  And what do you mean by \"write programs that compute judgments\"?  (I don't know anything about LCF.)"
