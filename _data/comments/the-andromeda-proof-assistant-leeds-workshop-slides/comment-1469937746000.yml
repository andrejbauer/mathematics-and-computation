message: "&gt; Are you saying that the way one actually codes in Andromeda is to use the extensional dependent type system as a meta-theory to describe some other object theory, the way one uses LF in Twelf?\n\n(I'm not sure this was addressed to me, but...) That is what the Andromeda guys have been doing to get type constructors other than Pi and equals. I wrote them an email pointing out the similarity to logical frameworks, and saying I think it makes a lot of sense, and that it will make even more sense once Type:Type is dropped. They were already aware of the similarity.\n\nYour point about a danger with Andromeda's type theory being too strong is right. I've given it some thought, and I'm pretty sure that there are at least two weak, extensional type theories that make sense for HOAS and judgments-as-types. One is basically just LF + extensional equality. (There was much more detail about this in my email to them.)"
