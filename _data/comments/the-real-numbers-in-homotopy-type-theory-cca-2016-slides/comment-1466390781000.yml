message: "I'm quite curious about what the higher homotopy is that we're killing off when we do the truncation. Certainly if we're aiming to define the *set* of real numbers, we should have such a truncation, but it feels a bit hasty, we might be throwing away something interesting about real numbers which could not be observed by classical means. (We also might not, it might be boring, but I'd like to know!)\n\nIf we leave out the truncation, we can consider the type Id R u u, and we can ask questions about whether Id R u u = Id R v v for a given pair of untruncated reals u and v. Will we always find such an equivalence, or does it reveal something number theoretical about u and v? Given the construction, it certainly wouldn't be too surprising to find that rationals have different local path structures than limit points...\n\nThis is just an itch that's been at the back of my mind since reading the HoTT book, I haven't really begun to approach it in a serious way. I'm curious if anyone else has had the same thought and more time to think about it."
