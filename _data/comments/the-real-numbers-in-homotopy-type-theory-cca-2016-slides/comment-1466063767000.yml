message: "@Andrej: The slides look nice. I wonder how people react to:\r\n\"realizability models (and thus TTE).\" :-)\r\nMaybe be a little less assertive that the Dedekind reals are not possible too in HoTT?\r\n\r\n\r\n@Mike:\r\nhttp://www.cse.chalmers.se/~nad/publications/altenkirch-danielsson-types2016.pdf\r\nhttp://www.cse.chalmers.se/~nad/listings/partiality-monad/README.html\r\nWe also speculated a bit about this direction at the IAS. e.g. 11.2.(iv) in the book. However, we didn't pursue it at that time."
