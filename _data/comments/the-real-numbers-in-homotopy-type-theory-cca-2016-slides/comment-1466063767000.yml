message: "@Andrej: The slides look nice. I wonder how people react to:\n\"realizability models (and thus TTE).\" :-)\nMaybe be a little less assertive that the Dedekind reals are not possible too in HoTT?\n\n\n@Mike:\nhttp://www.cse.chalmers.se/~nad/publications/altenkirch-danielsson-types2016.pdf\nhttp://www.cse.chalmers.se/~nad/listings/partiality-monad/README.html\nWe also speculated a bit about this direction at the IAS. e.g. 11.2.(iv) in the book. However, we didn't pursue it at that time."
