message: "If I understand you correctly, you are saying that we need to address more seriously the consequences of the Curry-Howard correspondance identifying proofs as programs.\r\n\r\nThe list of execution steps of a program is a very restrictive view of what the program is; reducing proofs to deductions steps would be a very restrictive limitation of what a proof can be."
