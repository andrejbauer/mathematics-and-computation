  Computation, generally construed, can be non-deterministic. In the case of
  non-deterministic computation, if someone gives you the input and the output
  you also need the trace in order to reproduce the computation. Otherwise,
  reproducing the computation may require an exponential search. There is
  (almost) nothing wrong to look at computation as a trace of equations. What is
  missing is the direction: computation rules are equations plus a direction of
  evaluation. So in general a computation can (and should) be presented as a
  sequence of inequations. If the computation is a mix of deterministic and
  non-deterministic rules then the only inequations that cannot be easily
  recovered are the non-deterministic ones.
