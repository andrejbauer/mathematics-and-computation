  I think you're right. I should have said: "An independent
  <strong>performance</strong> of a computation involves indepndently re-running
  the computation â€“ not verifying someone else's trace of it encoded as a
  derivation." My point is that computation just is, without any
  verification/condition/correctness/guarantee attached to it. And in this pure
  form, computation is useful. Let me give you an example. I will give you an
  example.


  I am thinking of a number. I will tell you which number it is. It's the one
  that is printed by the program:

  [sourcecode]

  k = 0

  n = 1000000000000

  while n &lt;&gt; 1:
      if n % 2 == 0: n = n / 2
      else: n = 3 * n + 1
      k = k + 1
  print(k)

  [/sourcecode]

  Now we are both thinking of the same number. Now, in this particular case
  there are other, more efficient ways of communicating the same number, but
  that is not going to be the case in general. The most efficient way to
  communicate numbers (or any kind of information) is to send programs.
