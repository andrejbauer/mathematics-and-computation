message: "In my understanding, your post identifies 3 sorts of formal proofs: proofs as derivations (deduction steps), as constructions, and as computation : for instance, you wrote \"I think this is fine as far as derivations and constructions go, but let us not forget computation\".\nDerivations, constructions and computation are here about proofs, we are working in the meta-theory: the proof is an object, we want not only to prove a proposition, but also to prove that the proof is correct.\nThe meta-proof that a proof is correct can be done by checking derivation steps, or constructions.\nBut in a more general way, a meta-proof is a meta-program (by the Curry Howard correspondence), that is to say a program that is able to build a correct proof.\nLimiting meta-proofs to the checking of deduction steps is therefore restrictive: this is how I understand the title of your post.\n\nDoes that make sense ?"
