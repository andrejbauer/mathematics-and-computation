message: "I think Neel was arguing against a Nuprl-style formal system, based on his example of injectivity of (-&gt;) not being admissible. (Computational type theory is a semantic approach, but Nuprl still has a formal system for the intended semantics.) Is that rule admissible in ETT? I would guess not, in which case his argument is not completely off the mark. I guess he's assuming that an LCF-style proof assistant is only desirable for certain formal systems, which means that you may want to avoid certain formal systems in order to avoid an LCF-style assistant.\n\n(I wouldn't agree with this assumption.)"
