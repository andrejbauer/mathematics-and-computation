message: "I think Dan Ghica is successfully refuting a very particular thing you said:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>An independent verification of a computation involves independently re-running the computation – not verifying someone else’s trace of it encoded as a derivation.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nIn case \"verifying a computation\" means confirming that <i>foo</i> is a possible outcome, and the computation is nondeterministic, re-running the computation is a bad way to verify it.\r\n\r\nOf course this doesn't mean nondeterministic computations cannot be used, it just means that possible outcomes are generally hard to find. So a proof that an outcome of a computation is possible should not just be the computation itself."
