  There is no logic which matches every possible natural mode of reasoning. We
  are therefore either doomed to have many proof assistants, or to have
  extensible proof assistants. If the latter, what for do such extensions take?
  Building internal models inside some logic is just one way of providing such
  flexibility. Another is to let the user describe to the proof assistant how to
  do things. That's computation.
