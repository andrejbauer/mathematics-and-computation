  You misunderstand me. Which bit of what I wrote made you think I am asking for
  NuPrl-style approach? So all of what you say about not wanting NuPrl-style is
  misdirected. In fact, I am <em>for</em> the axiomatic approach, as you call
  it. When I say that the trusted kernel must be able to run code that does
  <em>not</em> imply that the formalism is somehow tied to the code. Perhaps the
  code is there for other purposes, for instance to implement special-purpose
  decision procedures and such.


  Regarding fragility of formal developements and non-portability of proof
  scripts: when we know how to solve that problem we'll also know how to solve
  many, many other problems in software engineering.
