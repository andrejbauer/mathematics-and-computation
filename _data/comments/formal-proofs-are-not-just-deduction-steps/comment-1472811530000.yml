  I don't know if I dislike undecidable typechecking or not -- that seems too
  broad a question to me. Based on what Andrej is saying, though, I have
  misunderstood the point of his post sufficiently that this discussion would be
  off-topic. Why don't you email me your questions, and I can turn it into an
  interview/blog post?
