message: "Hi Andrej, what made me think of the Nuprl approach is this comment from your post:\r\n\r\n<blockquote> I suppose I do not have to explain my view here: there is little reason to make the user jump through hoops by having them encode computation as normalization, or application of tactics, or whatnot.  Just give them a programming language!</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI disagree with this, because I think there are very good reasons to encode computation as normalization: by keeping full computation out of the kernel, we get stronger properties for it (such as the decidability of typechecking), which makes giving reasonable declarative specifications of important features like type inference feasible. \r\n\r\n<blockquote>Regarding fragility of formal developements and non-portability of proof scripts: when we know how to solve that problem weâ€™ll also know how to solve many, many other problems in software engineering.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nWe do actually have a pretty good idea of how to solve such problems --  type theory!"
