  TLA+ lets you to logically assert that a computation (written in TLA+, as a
  temporal-logic-of-actions formula, the model of which is a set of traces)
  behaves in a certain way (computes a certain result, terminates within so many
  steps, deadlocks etc.). Computation as such -- not just as a means to reduce
  to an equality -- is part of the core logic. Instead of proving the result
  deductively, you can compute it in the model checker. The process isn't fully
  automatic -- i.e., you still need to write: "PROOF OMITTED" and add a comment
  saying "check in the model checker", but that's a UI issue.
