  There are many things you can state as a criterion for a non-deterministic
  computation: there exists a value such that $\phi$, all values satisfy $\phi$,
  and so on (you know this better than I do). Your example is "it is possible
  that the value will be $Y$" if I understand you correctly. I am not making any
  assumptions about what is or should be possible to state about computations. I
  am just saying that computations should be there. Even computations for which
  no correctness criterion is stated can still be very useful.
