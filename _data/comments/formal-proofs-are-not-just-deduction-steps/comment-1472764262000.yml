  No, you completely misunderstand me. This has nothing to do with the
  Curry-Howard correspondence. I would really like to know (from you and from
  Neel) what in the blog post makes you think I am talking about a particular
  formal system, or a family of them. Everything I say is completely uncommitted
  with respect to the underlying formalism. It applies equally well to an
  intuitionistic and classical setting.
