message: "This is a remark completely beside the main topic of this discussion and concerns only the introductory example of the post, regarding WRITING STYLE.\nClearly it is bad style to refer to the particulars of the proof when *using* a lemma/result. It is not just formally wrong, but it is also an annoyance for the reader.\n\n1. Would the proposed \"Problem/Construction\" style change anything? Would it now be OK to refer to details of the Construction from \"outside\"?\n\n2. I have been wondering why such \"existential\" statements like in the example are so ubiquitous. I would personally tend to replace \"Theorem: There exists a gadget x such that ?(x).\" by the statement \"Construction C produces a gadget x such that ?(x)\" because it is more specific, and it also states the constructive aspect of the result (as opposed to a purely existential result). But maybe Construction C is only of local interest for this theorem and does not deserve a name?\nThere seems to be no good tradition of how to write algorithmic (and constructive) results, and as Andrej points out, the enshrined Theorem-Proof style does cater well for this situation. For curiosity, I have checked a recent paper of mine, and we wrote \"Theorem 1. We can decide ... in O(n log n) time and O(n) space\", and in the arxiv version we did not even state a theorem: \"We solve this problem in O(n log n) time in 4 dimensions.\" The \"Problem/Construction\" style would also not work here, because the \"Construction\" is the main result of the paper, spanning many pages."
