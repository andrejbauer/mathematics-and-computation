message: "From your reply I think we may be talking about different things. \n\nIn a non-deterministic computation I can assert that some value Y can be produced by the program X but just by running X you cannot check the truth of my assertion. The only way you can check it is if I tell you what the choices whenever nondeterminism kicked in. \n\nDo you really dispute this?"
