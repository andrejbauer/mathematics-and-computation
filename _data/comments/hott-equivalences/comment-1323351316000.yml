message: "Having watched some of it, I find it wonderfully clear and quite illuminating. It is great to be able to jump around in the talk, eg to revisit things, or skip boring or laborious bits.\n\nI don't think I yet understand the relation between adjoint equivalences (between categories I presume) and the property of a function that all its fibres are contractible. The latter property requires there to be not only at least one isomorphism, but also something-more.  Are you saying that this something-more, up to bureaucratic shuffling around, amounts to a proof that certain triangles commute, in a certain sense? \n\nI have heard that it is a key property of the notion you call equivalence that to say that something\nis an equivalence is a proposition (ie. the space of paths between a pair of proofs of the proposition is contractible).  This somehow truncates things beneficially, so the possibility of paths between paths doesn't get too out of hand.  Do you agree, or how would you put it?\n\nIf I was offered three wishes, my first would be a remote control gizmo that would allow fast forward (or rewind) through life itself in some browsable fashion.  The ability to repair or delete history would be great too."
