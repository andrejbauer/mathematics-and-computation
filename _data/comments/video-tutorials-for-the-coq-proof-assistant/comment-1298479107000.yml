message: "Nice tutorials!\n\nI have experimented with videos too, in particular with <a href=\"http://apfelmus.nfshost.com/blog/2010/07/02-fixed-points-video/player.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">video/slideshow hybrids</a>. The idea is that some people don't like watching videos because they are hard to skim and navigate. Feel free to drop me a line in case you'd like to \"steal\" anything, I'm happy to make this open source etc.\n\nFor real math, a pen tablet works quite well; I simply copied the style of <a href=\"http://www.khanacademy.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Khan Academy</a>. The 90â‚¬ purchase is easily justified with the observation that \"professional mathematicians need professional tools\". I think that blackboard or paper don't work so well because the visual quality tends to be rather poor. CCD noise, compression artifacts etc. That said, it <i>is</i> a tad easier for me to do nice handwriting on paper.\n\nConcerning hearing your own voice, I have found that applying an audio plugin that simulates light reverb / room ambience can help."
