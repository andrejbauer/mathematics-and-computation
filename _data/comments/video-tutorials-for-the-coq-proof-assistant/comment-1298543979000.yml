message: "I bought a <a href=\"http://www.wacom.com/bamboo/bamboo_fun.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wacom Bamboo Fun</a>. Works flawlessly with my Mac. Highly configurable, too.\r\n\r\nNote that the Bamboo Fun has (had?) two different sizes: a smaller S version and a larger M version. (The website only shows the larger version.) I bought the smaller version, whose pen sensitive area has the size of a postcard. If I were to buy again and if I had sufficient funds, I would buy the larger version, though, because that leaves more room for handwriting."
