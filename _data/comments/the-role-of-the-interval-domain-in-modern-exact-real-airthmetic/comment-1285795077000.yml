message: "In addition to interval arithmetic, have you have a chance to look at Taylor models? \n\nThese basically consist of the first n terms of a Taylor series and an interval to contain the slop and you can push the rounding error on the higher order coefficients into the interval. Berz and Makino have done a lot of work in this space.\n\nThe advantage is that while the intervals expand, they are vastly smaller in this arrangement, and there exist tricks for reconditioning the Taylor model.\n\nI started to build a library in Haskell for working with these, but it used MPFR, which depended on GMP, and the Haskell MPFR bindings are broken due to internal changes/bug fixes in MPFR making it lean more heavily on the GMP allocator in a way that makes it incompatible with GHC's rewiring of that very same allocator."
