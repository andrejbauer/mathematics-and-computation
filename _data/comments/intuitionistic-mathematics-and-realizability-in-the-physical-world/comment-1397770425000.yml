  This is a very awesome, friendly, short paper; I'm using it to get some of my
  curious friends introduced to higher math. However, one thing worries me. Let
  $h(x) = 1/x$. This should certainly be definable for $x > 0$. Then
  micro-affinity implies the existence of a unique $k$ such that for all
  infinitesimal $dx$, $h(1+dx)-h(1) = k \, dx$. Now, $h(1+dx) - h(1) = 1/(1+dx)
  - 1 = - dx/(1+dx) = k \, dx$. This worries me. I'm not quite sure I can get a
  contradiction from it, because not every infinitesimal is invertible, but it
  still makes me feel uncomfortable. This probably stems from me not knowing
  synthetic differential geometry and making a logic error somewhere. The paper
  is (mercifully!) not explicit about how the reals are constructed, maybe the
  problem is hiding in there somewhere? Or maybe this is all correct and it's my
  intuition that's wrong? Anyways, thanks for the clear exposition.
