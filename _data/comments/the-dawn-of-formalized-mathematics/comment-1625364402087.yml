  I stopped when Russell and whitehead gave up their project as formalization
  (set theory plus logic) can do all maths are found to be fault by a guy I love
  and hate in 1920s. And the whole Programme is an issue as someone commented
  hinted at it.  Maths is all about creation and whilst after your creation you
  have to talked about it.  It is sort of Latin to academic research.  May be
  you have to use it so others can understand and prove it, it is not what maths
  are about.  And the fun is not there.  Latin is a dead language.  Useful and
  log ally but dead.  Formalism may not be but is it just Latin in disguise,
  given there is no philosophical ground to it, no fun to it, no helping of
  innovation and creativity to it.
