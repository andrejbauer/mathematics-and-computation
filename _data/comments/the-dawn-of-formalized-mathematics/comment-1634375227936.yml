  I found the point about "implicit mathematical knowledge" very interesting.
  It's probably one of the reasons mathematics can be so concise. A similar
  issue comes up when trying to convert mathematics into usable software: Things
  have to be made explicit. Can you recommend any further reading on this topic?
