message: "Whether it is wrong, I won't discuss (Andrej is smart, and he says it is, he probably sees something I don't). But the thing is, it _cannot_ be \"fixed\" (made to work like Andrej expects it to) without completely changing the rules for variables lookup. And it probably won't be Python anymore, it would be too different (for example, I have a strong hunch it would _have_ to require declarations for variables). Because you'd have to close around _everything_ accessible at the moment of definition of function, and you don't really know what that could be (it can call some other function, that sees something else, and whether that function is called might be undecidable).\n\nBesides, I see mcmanus still didn't get a reply. I'll try once more.\n\ni=1\nf=lambda:i\ni=2\nf()\n\nWhat do you expect?\n\nfrom random import randrange\nf=lambda:randrange(1e5)\nf()!=f()\n\nAnd now?"
