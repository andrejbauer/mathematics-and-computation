message: "This is not just a Pythonic phenomenon. IIRC, both Ruby and C# (and doubtless more languages besides) all make this choice for closures over mutable variables. It definitely confuses you when you see it for the first time, but the alternative behaviour you want has the potential to be even more confusing in some situations IMHO.\r\n\r\nNote also that:\r\n\r\n* You can recover closures over immutable variables with local declarations quite easily (this is similar to what you show above):\r\n\r\nfor (int i = 0; i  i' + x);\r\n}\r\n\r\n* You cannot recover closures over mutable variables if you only close over immutable values without quite a bit of fiddling around with arrays or similar:\r\n\r\n-- Now I want the 'incorrect' behaviour:\r\nfor (int[] i = { 0 }; i[0]  i[0] + x)\r\n}\r\n\r\nIt's swings and roundabouts as usual :-)"
