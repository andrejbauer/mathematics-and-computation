message: "Looks like (as you say) the problem is not with lambda, but with the environment - the 'i' in the lambda, as with the named function, is bound to the global 'i':\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; fs = [(lambda n: i + n) for i in range(10)]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; fs[3](4)\n13\n&gt;&gt;&gt; i=38\n&gt;&gt;&gt; fs[3](4)\n42\n\nThe same 'fix' as in your def works for lambda as well:\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; fs = [(lambda n, i=i: i + n) for i in range(10)]\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; fs[3](4)\n    7\n\nLua, one of my favorite little languages, also gets it right:\n    &gt; f={}\n    &gt; for i = 0, 9 do f[i] = function(n) return i + n end end\n    &gt; print(f[3](4))\n    7\n    &gt; i=38\n    &gt; print(f[3](4))\n    7"
