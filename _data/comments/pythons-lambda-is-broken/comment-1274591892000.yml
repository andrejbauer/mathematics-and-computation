message: "@Evan: your argument can be applied to other constructs as well. In Python we do not really need dictionaries because they can be replaced by association lists. I can tell you from personal experience that dictionaries are far more confusing for students than lists. This line of reasoning does not work very well. But yes, a language needs a balanced set of features.\r\n\r\nThe question is whether lambda belongs to such a set. There are many reasons why the answer is positive. For example, lambda abstraction is one part of a fundamental mathematical concept, namely that of a <b>function</b>, the other part being application (of a function to an argument). It seems clear to me that such a primitive concept can be useful and probably should be part of a language.\r\n\r\nIf we designed languages according to what \"production environment workers\" can comprehend, we'd still be hunting with sticks and stones."
