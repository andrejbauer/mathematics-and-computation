message: "Following on from what Svat said, in introductory javascript books, there is always a warning about assigning event listeners in loops with the value for the loop exit condition being assigned, instead of the 1, 2, 3, etc expected. The solution given is to use a closure and the <code>(function(n){})(n);</code> construct.\r\n[sourcecode gutter=\"false\"][/sourcecode]\r\nvar fs = {};\r\nfor(var i=0; i&lt;5; i++) {\r\nfs[i]= (function(i){\r\nreturn function(n) { return n+i; }\r\n})(i);\r\n}\r\n\r\nfor(var j in fs) {\r\n  console.log(&quot;fs[&quot; + j +&quot;] =&quot; ,fs[j](100));\r\n}\r\n\r\nI am reasonably new to functional programming, but the supposed \"issue\" with python seems quite reasonable when viewed through javascript eyes."
