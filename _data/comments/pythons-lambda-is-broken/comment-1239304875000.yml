message: "Not broken, though, admittedly, when I first ran into this I threw up in my mouth a little. C# actually handles lambdas the way you'd expect but I believe Actionscript 3 has the same issue as Python here. A much simpler looking change would be to do this:\r\n\r\nfs = [(lambda n, i = i: i + n) for i in range(10)]\r\n\r\nor for clarity\r\n\r\nfs = [(lambda n, k = i: k + n) for i in range(10)]\r\n\r\nwhich is also the same as doing this:\r\n\r\ndef statefulLambda(i):\r\n    return lambda n: i + n\r\n\r\nfs = [statefulLambda(i) for i in range(10)]\r\n\r\nAs luqui said, you basically need to capture the state of the i variable in a block. Since Python doesn't do that for you, it means you need to initialize a new variable to store that data in with each function you create. At least that's how I think about it."
