message: "Reply to Jason (29): Design choices are (almost) always intentional. I really am saying that the intentional design choice is mistaken. But I understand that it fits in with the rest of Python.\r\n\r\nIt seems like people think I hate Python. I teach python programming (by my choice). I also do web programming with Django, and it's much better than other things I've tried (perl, ocaml, java)."
