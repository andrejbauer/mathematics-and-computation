message: "This is the very same lambda as is in Perl, Ruby, C#, (probably lisp and scheme, too).  The brokenness here is more about list comprehensions/iterators using a single mutable variable instead of a new binding.  In python it is particularly hard to get it right, because variables are def-scoped, rather than block scoped.  \"Obvious\" optimizations for imperative programmers = hell for functional programmers.\n\nLambdas closing over mutable variables get hard to think about really fast."
