message: "@Andrej (20)\r\n\r\nThis isn't a design error.  It's quite intentional actually.  It's just a matter of Python having different scoping rules and treating all statements as executable.  Guido has a pretty good overview of how this came about.[1]\r\n\r\nThink about it this way.  In a language like C, a statement like this:\r\n\r\n    int i = 0;\r\n\r\nis a directive to the compiler.  Where as in python, this statement:\r\n\r\n    i = 0\r\n\r\nis an executable statement that's run at runtime.  I would argue that the case that you mention is one of those \"just because you can doesn't mean you should\" situations.  However, this *does* allow for some more natural syntax.  Consider the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n    if x == y:\r\n        z = 0\r\n    else:\r\n        z = 1\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is more natural than the alternative even if only by a little bit.\r\n\r\n[1] http://python-history.blogspot.com/2009/03/how-everything-became-executable.html"
