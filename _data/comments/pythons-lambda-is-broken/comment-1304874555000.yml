message: "Andrej, was just checking back and noticed someone had already given my explanation about location vs. value. Then I noticed your remark about the comprehension leaving <code>i</code> in the global scope. (I agree this is laughable.) I wondered if my explanation was wrong and Python was just referencing the leftover global <code>i</code>. Actually, it seems both explanations are right, since you can alter the value of the closure by assigning to the leftover global!\n\n<code>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; i=2\n&gt;&gt;&gt; i\n2\n&gt;&gt;&gt; fs = [(lambda n: i + n) for i in range(10)]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; fs[3](0)\n9\n&gt;&gt;&gt; i\n9\n&gt;&gt;&gt; i = 0\n&gt;&gt;&gt; fs[3](4)\n4\n</code>"
