message: "I've always thought nonstandard elements are an indication that you should carefully consider what you've taken to be the propositions. \r\n\r\nAfter all, the natural numbers just are those things which makes the induction axiom true, and because you have some freedom in how you can set up your  logical connectives, it seems natural to me that what the natural numbers are may vary as well. My favorite example is light set theory, which is set theory with a linear -- rather than classical -- ambient logic, and so unary and binary representations of the natural numbers are no longer isomorphic! (It also consistently  supports naive comprehension, among its other charms.)"
