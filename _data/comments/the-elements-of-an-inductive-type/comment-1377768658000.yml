message: "Thanks for writing about a topic that has been puzzling me for a while. I think I understand the issue a bit better now, but I still feel uncomfortable about the way you put it.\r\n\r\nI understand that \"freely generated\" does not mean the same thing in hott and in usual type theory, hence different elimination principles for types freely generated from constructors.\r\n\r\nHowever, I find it abusive and confusing that you are defining \"inductive\" as just \"freely generated\". How then do you distinguish \"inductive\" from \"coinductive\" after that?\r\n\r\nFinally, I am not convinced by your use of non-standard models to refute the usual intuition of inductive types. If the model of Nat contains elements that are not generated from constructors, they should be indistinguishable from the non-exotic natural numbers for the induction principle to hold. So the intuition is not violated \"inside\" the logic, and it still means something (necessarily more complex) when considering models of the logic. Another way to put it: it seems to me that the argument you applied to refute the definition of \"inductive\" could be applied in the same way to refute the definition of \"freely generated\", by considering an exotic model containing two distinct objects behaving the same wrt. all interpretations."
