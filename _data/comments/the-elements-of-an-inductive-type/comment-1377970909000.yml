message: "@Jesse: Peter Lumsdaine brought up a similar question last year.  More generally, for what functors $G$ can we have an \"inductive type\" $W$ with constructors that output $G(W)$?  We know what conditions on a functor $F$ to impose so that the constructors of $W$ can have <i>input</i> $F(W)$, namely $F$ should be a polynomial functor (syntactically, it should be strictly positive).  However, this isn't sufficient as a condition on G, as I think your example shows; at least, there's no obvious way to make sense out of the definition of \"ghostly\".\n\nThe appropriate condition on top of polynomiality for $G$ seems to be that $G(1)=1$.  This is true for $G(X) = Id_X$, but not for $G(X) = 1+X$.  Semantically, the reason this makes sense is that if a polynomial functor satisfies $G(1)=1$, then (at least in well-behaved models) it has a left adjoint $L$, and so a constructor of type $F(W) \\to G(W)$ can instead be regarded as a constructor of type $L(F(W)) \\to W$, which is easier to construct in models and derive an induction principle for.  And indeed, this is how we construct models of higher inductive types: we use the fact that the simplicial path object construction $X^{\\Delta^1}$ has a left adjoint, the simplicial cylinder $Y\\times \\Delta^1$."
