message: "@Andrej, thanks for your answer. I now realize one big mistake: I was thinking \"injectivity of constructors\" for \"free generation\". The latter is obviously stronger, and can indeed be taken as a definition of inductive.\r\n\r\nShame on me for this confusion: I was too eager to map what you're doing to familiar concepts, such as pattern-matching, induction and coinduction, maybe because the equality example in Section 5.8 looks (to me) more like a pattern-matching than an induction principle. (In e.g. Coq, pattern matching and fix are combined to get induction principles, but it seems useful to separate the two concepts when possible.)\r\n\r\nRegarding more the philosophical points of exotic models and intuitions versus formal definitions, I don't see anything useful to add. But thanks for the example of adding an explicit exotic c constant to nat: I find it a bit shocking but I see that in several respects you can still call the extended nat an inductive type."
