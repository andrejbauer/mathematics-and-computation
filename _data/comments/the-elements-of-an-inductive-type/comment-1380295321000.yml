message: "@Peter:  You definitely have a point there, the only way to make “all elements of $\\mathbb{N}$ are reachable by constructor application” false is to mix external and internal notions. But I think what happens is this: people only know about models in which this difference does not matter, and are therefore not aware of it. Consequently, they think all models have this property.\n\nFor instance, a typical hard-core type theorist, as far as I can tell, lives in some sort of a syntactic model. Can he tell the difference between internal and external? Sometimes, e.g., when thinking about functions $\\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}$, he is perfectly aware that the ones he can define in type theory are not exactly all of them (not even all the computable ones). But when he thinks about $\\mathbb{N}$ he knows that every (global!) point of $\\mathbb{N}$ is denoted by some term of type theory. And this intuition carries over to inductive types, and then falsely to inductive types in all models. The net result is that the identity type looks weird.\n\nWhich brings me to the following dillema. Suppose I want to explain the difference between internal and external to a person who cannot yet tell the difference, and he has never seen exotic models. Shouldn't I then show the exotic model and \"mix the internal and external\" viewpoints to first show him the sins he has commited? How would you explain it?"
