  By the way, @Andrej — may I disagree with you on the lead statement of this
  post?  It seems to me analogous to saying that countable models of set theory
  debunk the fact “$\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable”.


  Exotic models, and the surprising interpretations of inductive types in them,
  are certainly important for understanding type theory; but what they show is
  surely just the <em>non-absoluteness</em> of the notions of inductive type,
  element, and reachability.  The external “all elements” is not the internal
  one; the $\mathbb{N}$ of the model is not the $\mathbb{N}$ of the
  meta-theory.  The only way to read “all elements of $\mathbb{N}$ are reachable
  by constructor application” as false is to interpret it half-in and half-out
  of the model — “all elements [in some external sense] of $\mathbb{N}$ [in the
  model’s sense] are reachable [in the external sense]” — which seems rather
  cruel and usual treatment for a poor proposition!
   
  (I don’t disagree though with the slightly different points made in the linked
  section of the Book, about the importance of recognising that e.g. identity
  types are not freely generated types, but freely generated <em>families</em>.)
