message: "So, here is a silly question I wanted to ask a while ago, just because, but now it seems even more appropriate to do so.\r\n\r\nThere are all these oodles of marvelous things one can prove about identity types before supposing identity types of any particular type to be interesting; I'm pretty sure one can even in principle write down all the elements of the homotopy of spheres, as polymorphic maps between higher identity types... and the marvelous magical thing is that supposing any number of spaces have interesting homotopy doesn't break any of that.\r\n\r\nThere are things one can prove about the freely-adjoint-a-point type (call it Plus for now), one can build adjunctions around it and so on, in as much detail and coherence as you have patience for; So, does anything go wrong with supposing a plus-er inductive type\r\n<blockquote><code>pInductive ghostly := spectre : Plus ghostly.</code></blockquote>\r\nThen <code>Plus ghostly</code> will seem to have two points: spectre, and the freely-adjoined point; but in the absence of a retraction of the Plus monad unit morphism, I'm sure there are no terms of type ghostly; and I think I can even half-way think of a model interpreting ghostly in a sensible way.\r\n\r\nI think what I'm driving at is: beyond, say, syntactic positivity, is there something special about identity types that makes higher inductive types work? What makes them really nifty of course is living on a diagonal, but if we ever want a proof assistant with native higher inductive types, is it useful to restrict their declarations to freely adjoining higher identity terms, or might it be fruitful to consider other layers of structure, too?"
