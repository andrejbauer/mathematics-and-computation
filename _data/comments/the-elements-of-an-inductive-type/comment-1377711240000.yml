  The ultrapower construction is a completion in the following sense: adjoin all
  elements whose first-order properties are contradiction-free.


  For instance, the family of inequalities $\lbrace x > n \mid  n = 1, 2, 3,
  \ldots \rbrace$ is contradiction-free, because any finite subset of them
  certainly has a solution $x$. (In particular, take $x = m+1$ where $m$ is the
  size of the subset of inequalities considered.) Hence, you can adjoin an
  element $X$ which fulfills all of these inequalities. It's very similar to
  GÃ¶del's compactness theorem.
