  The L-S theorems, and the existence of non-standard models of arithmetic are
  both rather tied to first-order logic.  If you present PA in a &gt;1 order
  logic, you do get a much stronger picture of the natural numbers (one that
  doesn't allow for members other than the zero and its successors).  (There's
  some discussion in Chapter 18 of the 3rd edition of "Computability and Logic"
  by Boolos and Jeffrey for example.)
