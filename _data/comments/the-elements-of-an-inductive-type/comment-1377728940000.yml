  @Barak: Non-standard integers are irrelevant when I speak about syntax and use
  phrases such as "finitely many times". Firstly, you cannot bring in
  non-standard integers because I do not need any math to understand what
  "finitely many" means, and so I can simply ignore any kind of mathematical and
  logical sophistry. But even if I accept your game and start to worry that
  perhaps I live in a model with non-standard integers, that is completely
  irrelevant. If I live in such a model, there is no way for me to know that
  (because I am in the model and have no way to observe it from a meta-level),
  and neither does existence of non-standard integers invalidate any of my
  reasoning. So I think your worries are empty.
