  @David: the $\mathtt{nat}$ with an exotic constant is inductive in the sense
  that it still satisfies Peano's induction axiom. But we have to be a bit
  careful about it, because the axioms we add are <em>not</em> so innocent.
  There are infinitely many of them, they are negated equations rather than
  equations, etc. So it gets harder to interpret the theory.
