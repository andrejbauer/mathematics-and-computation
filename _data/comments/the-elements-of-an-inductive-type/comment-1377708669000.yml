message: "Thanks for commenting on an important topic.   I think the point is that type theory is intended to be a language for describing an existing mathematical reality, and the theorems proved in the language are intended to be about that reality, but focusing on the details of the language tends to obscure that.  I was stuck with that impression for half of our special year!\r\n\r\nThere's something a bit odd about your definition of \"exotic\" model, in that it supposes that every model interprets types as things with elements, i.e., as sets.  But your examples don't do that: for example, a sheaf is not a set.  A pointed set isn't even a set."
