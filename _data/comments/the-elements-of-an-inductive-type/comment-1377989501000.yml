message: "@Mike: that's rather nifty! Was this caught in one of the videos? Was it the subject of one of the videos?  I do like adjunctions...\r\n\r\nAnd yet, I don't yet see whatever difficulty you're seeing with the thing I'm wondering about. What an inductive $\\_ + 1$ type really looks like to me is a quantum or thermodynamical system with two degenerate energy levels: some of the dynamics isn't visible untill the system is excited by something (or because of interference, in case that analogy makes any more sense).  But the model I had in mind was just filtered (ordinary) types and filtered maps between them, and where (don't ask why) $\\_ + 1$ is interpreted as shifting the filtration by one."
