message: "@David: first of all, freely generated means only one thing in all contexts, including HoTT (but in HoTT you have to state it carefully because there is proof relevance to worry about): a structure is freely generated when it is obtained by application of a left adjoint to a forgetful functor. This is the most encompassing notion of \"free\" that I know of. Inductive definitions are just a very special case of left adjoints.\r\n\r\nCoinductive definitions are <em>not</em> freely generated. A coinductive type is <em>not</em> obtained by (possibly non-well founded) applications of constructors, even though Coq would have you believe that.  They are coalgebras, and so we have to suitably dualize everything. We get destructors, and co-induction, etc., and this is all very clearly different from free generation.\r\n\r\nAbout your last remark: yes, of course inside type theory the standard and exotic elements have precisely the same status, namely they are elements. It takes a meta-theoretic observation to distinguish them. But it is a mistake to draw the conclusion \"it is safe to imagine inside the logic that all elements are standard\". It is also a mistake to draw the conclusion \"it is safe to imagine inside the logic that there are exotic elements\". The logic says nothing about the distinction between the standard and exotic elements, and so <em>no</em> conclusion can be drawn. You need at least a bit of meta-reasoning. For instance, you could try to validate your belief by proving that for a free variable $x : \\mathtt{nat}$ the infinite set of formulas $$\\lbrace{ \\lnot(x = 0), \\lnot(x = S(0)), \\lnot (x = S(S(0))), \\ldots  \\rbrace}$$ entails a contradiction. But you will fail in doing so, because it is consistent to adjoin a new constant $c$ and a set of axioms $\\lnot(c = 0)$, $\\lnot(c = S(0))$, $\\lnot(c = S(S(0))$, etc. And that is just a meta-theoretic way of saying that it <em>is</em> safe to imagine exotic elements. The ghosts of exotic models are there to haunt you, whether you like it or not.\r\n\r\nYou say at some point that I \"refuted the definition of inductive\" by showing non-standard models. I take it from this that you think the definition of inductive is \"the set of those elements which can be obtained by successive (or well-founded) applications of the constructors\". But this is no definition, it is just an intuition disgued as one. It is a faulty definition because it leads to circular arguments about what \"well-founded\" or \"finite\" means. Instead, you must define the inductive type either as an initial algebra for some functor, or as a set satisfying a certain induction principle, or something like that. And that is where the exotic elements creep in! But that is a good thing. Not only have you fixed a faulty definition, at the same time you discovered new mathematical structures, learnt something about the limitations of your formalism, and most importantly, broadened your imagination so you are ready to discover new things."
