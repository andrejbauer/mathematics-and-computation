message: "@Neel: I think your argument applies to the usual first-order model theoretic way of doing things, where the structure of natural numbers is studied in isolation. When the natural numbers are characterized by their universal property inside a mathematical universe (a category), they are determined up to unique isomorphism. This reassures us that we pinpointed the correct notion.\n\nFor instance, the non-standard model of arithmetic looks \"wrong\" only if you study it in isolation. As soon as you look at the entire ultrapower model of ZFC, the non-standard natural numbers fit in perfectly.\n\nIt is futile to invent reasons against exotic or unwanted models. Logic is telling us that they are unavoidable. That has got to mean something."
