  In a curious twist (which some might call "ironic", but I'm not sure that
  means what such folk think it means...) my browser can't quite guess what
  character encoding this page means to use.  Specifically, I am seeing rogue
  "Â" characters in odd places, such as:


  "There must be a software equivalent of theÂ second law of thermodynamics,
  let’s call it the Law of Rotting Software:


  <code>“All software eventually fails, even if it you leave it alone.”"
