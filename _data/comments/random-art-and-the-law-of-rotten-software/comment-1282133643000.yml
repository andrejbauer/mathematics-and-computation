  Andrej, I feel your pain! I embarked on the futile project of making a G3
  Power Mac my web server, and even if I succeeded in the end the task left me
  somewhat scarred. It's not so much that software itself decays, it's the
  dependencies that diverge relentlessly. No matter how pure we write our code,
  it always depends on something else, and if we don't port our code it will be
  left behind, eventually.
