message: "Well, it's fun because I was thinking that the interesting part in your random art is not the generation algorithm but the functions used and I see you released the algorithm and some functions but you keep the nicest functions.\r\n\r\nI guess this is normal as the functions are the \"art\" part of the project and your additionnal value over the plain theoric application.\r\n\r\nNice work indeed !"
