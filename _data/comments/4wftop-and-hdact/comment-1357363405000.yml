message: "Hi,\r\n\r\nFWIW, The raw files have been up here for a while (since the conference actaully).\r\nI don't have time to edit any of the talks. There has been recording of the other talks as well, but not by me.\r\nIf there is anything you particularly like to see, let me know...\r\n\r\nhttp://pulse.defekt.nl/lectures/\r\n\r\nFor me personally it was a very nice and inspiring conference. Special thanks to Andrej, he did a very nice job organizing this and taking care of everyone."
