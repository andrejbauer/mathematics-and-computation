message: "Confusion between $phi$ and $\\forall x.\\phi$ is only possible when the latter is assumed to be true. Clearly, if $\\forall x.\\phi$ is false, then is usage is very different from the usage of $\\phi$.\r\n\r\nI guess the \"implicit universal quantification\" stems from the very ancient idea that all formulas that happen during a proof must be true."
