message: "I think there are a couple of reasons for this.\n\n1) Some presentations of logic actually have that, in certain circumstances. I can point to the discussion in chapter 8 of GEB as a specific example:\n\n   \"Rule of Generalization: Suppose x is a theorem in which u, a variable, occurs free. Then, ?u: x is a theorem. (Restrinction: No generalization is allowed in a fantasy on any variable which appeared free in the fantasy's premise.\"\n\n2) I'd guess that if you asked them about particular examples, they'd agree that particular examples weren't universally quantified, or that the variables are implicitly bound. The issue here is that mathematical english doesn't have a linear translation into explicit logical syntax, so the scope of bound variables isn't necesarilt obvious.\n\nA couple of comments on some of your specific points.\n\n1) \"x+sin x\" can certainly be the notation for a function, even if it is somewhat sloppy and ambiguous. And I am sure it causes endless confusion for undergraduates. But that doesn't change the fact that in the appropriate context (i.e, when talking about functions on the complex plain), refering to the function \"x + sin x\" is mostly unambiguous\n\n2) I wouldn't say that “Consider any x??. Then bla bla bla, therefore ?.” introduces a free variable, it just moves it to the context. Certainly, it occurs in formulas as free, but it isn't globally free."
