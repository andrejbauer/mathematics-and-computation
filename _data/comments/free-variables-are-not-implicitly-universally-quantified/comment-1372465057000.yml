message: "There should really be two separate threads, about using (or abusing) expressions as a notation for functions, and about \"implicit\" universal quantification. Here is a post on quantification.\n\nAndrey, why is there no need to quantify variables in axioms? Isn't the associative law $a*(b*c)=(a*b)*c$ supposed to hold <em>for all</em> elements $a,b,c$ of the group? I noted that Paul Taylor in his post of\nDecember 26 also objected to the use of quantifiers in such a case, but as an ordinary mathematician who never uses turnstyles in his work, I don't understand why. For me, the reason why we don't need to (explicitly) quantify $a,b,c$ when we write the associative law is precisely that they are implicitly universally quantified.\n\nHere is an extract form some hypothetical mathematical article. A series of derivations is concluded by the remark: \"For the transition from the second to the third line, we have used the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, $\\langle x,y\\rangle^2\\le\\|x\\|^2\\cdot\\|y\\|^2$.\" Suppose that $x$ and $y$ do not appear otherwise in this passage.\nWhat might the author mean? Tick one of the following boxes.\n\n - a) $\\Box$ $\\forall n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\colon\\forall x,y\\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\colon\\langle x,y\\rangle^2\\le\\|x\\|^2\\cdot\\|y\\|^2$\n\n - b) $\\Box$ $\\exists n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\colon\\forall x,y\\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\colon\\langle x,y\\rangle^2\\le\\|x\\|^2\\cdot\\|y\\|^2$\n\n - c) $\\Box$ $\\exists n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\colon\\exists x,y\\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\colon\\langle x,y\\rangle^2\\le\\|x\\|^2\\cdot\\|y\\|^2$\n\n - d) $\\Box$ $\\forall n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\colon\\exists x,y\\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\colon\\langle x,y\\rangle^2\\le\\|x\\|^2\\cdot\\|y\\|^2$\n\n - e) $\\Box$ It cannot be determined what this means without specifying what the values of $x$ and $y$ are.\n\n - f) $\\Box$ It is the  Cauchy-Schwarz-<em>Buniakovski</em> inequality.\n\n - g) $\\Box$ This mathematician is doing\n a great disservice to mathematics by this triviality, because everybody <em>knows</em> the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality.\n\nHave you ticked?\n\n(This example is weak because the correct answer is (g). Imagine a lesser-known inequality or identity.)\n\nI think every variable that is used meaningfully in mathematical discourse is bound <em>somehow</em>, either by defining its value, or by explicitly quantifying it, or implicitly. The default binding is the universal quantification. Every claim in a mathematical paper can be converted into a fully quantified statement without free variables. The phrase “Consider any $x??$... blabla\" in Reason 6 <em>binds</em> $x$, and as the word \"any\" suggests, it is a universal quantification here. Everything that is said about $x$ in \"blabla\" is supposed to hold for all $x$. There is no contradiction to the fact that $x$ is used as a free variable in \"blabla\". (Actually I am now puzzled completely why this example should be at all a \"reason\" against implicit quantification: The variable $x$ is <em>explicitly</em> quantified here.)\n\nOr maybe we are talking about different things. In \"$\\exists x\\colon x&gt;2$\", $x$ occurs as a free variable in \"$x&gt;2$\", but it would of course be nonsense to prepend \"$\\forall x$\" to it because \"free variables are implicitly universally quantified”. I am talking about a useful convention that any free variables that remain free at the outermost level after all bindings have been resolved, are implicitly considered as universally quantified. For example, a lemma in a book that I am reading starts with: \"Let $n\\ge-2, \\dots$\". The variable $n$ is not explicitly quantified. What is the intended meaning? Should it mean \"$\\forall n\\ge -2\\dots$\"?"
