  Essentially, I disagree with GÃ¼nter. There is absolutely no need to quantify
  variables in axioms. They can be left free. Why would we want to quantify them
  universally? To artificially increase their logical complexity in the name of
  general confusion pervading treatment of free variables?


  The "big O" notation is an abomination that is just as bad as the broken
  notation in analysis. We should in fact write $O(\lambda n . n^2)$ instead of
  $O(n^2)$. Complexity theorists write nonsense such as $2^{O(n)}$ out of
  laziness which then they claim to be convenience.


  Likewise, I do think we should write $\lambda n . 2n+ k$ when we think of a
  monotone map. And no, you did not "catch" me because there is no need to
  quantify $k$ in this expression. That is the whole point of what I am saying,
  namely, that variables are not always quantified, and for good reasons.
