  @Michael: it is precisely the missing context, or to be more precise, the
  missing abstraction, which is the problem. The expressions $x + \sin x$
  denotes a <b>number</b>. This number depends on another number $x$, but so
  what? To get a function out of this you have to write something like $x
  \mapsto x + \sin x$ or $(x,y) \mapsto x + \sin x$, at which point it becomes
  clear what this function maps from (in the first case from $\mathbb{R}$ and in
  the second $\mathbb{R^2}$). Mahtematicians are doing themselves a great
  disservice by saying things like "$n + 3 k$ is an odd number" at one point,
  and then "$n + 3 k$ is a monotone function" at another. They should say "$n +
  3 k$ is an odd number$" but $n \mapsto n + 3 k$" is a monotone function".
