message: "How exactly does type theory get this wrong? It has (conceivably; depending on what system we're talking about) all three of these things:\n\n$\\Gamma, x:S \\vdash \\phi \\, x : T$\n$\\Gamma \\vdash (\\lambda x : S. \\phi \\, x) : S \\rightarrow T$\n$\\Gamma \\vdash \\forall x : S. \\phi \\, x type$\n\nDepending on what $\\phi$ is. And they're all different (though related by inference rules). The first two correspond to something like:\n\n$\\Gamma \\times S \\to T$\n$\\Gamma \\to T^S$\n\nAnd the last is a rather different animal. It's written differently in the category theory, but it's the same distinction.\n\nIf you're referring to the syntax people use in something like Coq or Agda, a lot of this is elided because it can be reconstructed by a machine, and would be a burden to write down explicitly. People do tend to be less precise about the distinction when working in this format, but the vast majority of papers trying to be at all precise use the more formal proof trees with contextual judgments and whatnot, and I'd expect people studying type theory to be familiar with them."
