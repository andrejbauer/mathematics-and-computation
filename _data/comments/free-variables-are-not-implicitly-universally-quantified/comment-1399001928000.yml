message: "You make an assertion that ?x.? cannot be demonstrated without using free variables, and seem to suggest  that the only way to do without is to use combinators. There's a book by Quine called \"Mathematical Logic\", where he manages quite well without  introducing any free variables, using ?? to refer to 'the universal closure of ?'  (meaning the result of prepending it with universal quantifiers for all free variables in alphabetic order), and just states a sentence after its number to state it's a theorem (or theorem schemata). All theorems of his system have no free variables, and he never introduces free variables into his proofs: basically all you need is to introduce a few helpful theorem schemata for substitution into and out of a quantified expression. If your point is that it's inconvenient to write proofs without quantifiers, that's a judgement relative to the way you were taught. If you prefer writing proofs in English, there are a limited number of logical forms which can easily be represented, but if you are more fond of working in a semi-formal way, it's just as easy to develop good algebraic intuitions for how to manipulate quantified formulas into the desired form, as it is to develop the same intuitions for open formulas.\r\n\r\nEither way, I think \"cannot\" should be changed in that case to \"I find it unpleasant to work without free variables.\"."
