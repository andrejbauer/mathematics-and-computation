message: "I'm having the same questions as Eduardo and Tom Prince. \n\nAll of the presentations I have seen of first order logic include the derivation rule of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_generalization\" rel=\"nofollow\">Universal generalization</a>. As someone who strongly agrees with this post, this rule has always seemed blatantly false to me.\n\nI thought that the right way to fix it is to ban free variables from formal derivations. Of course, in math as it is normally written, one writes \"Suppose $x$ is a real number ...\" and continues from there. My proposal would be that this \"suppose\" means that every single sentence which follows begins with an implicit $\\forall_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}} \\cdots$ and that, when giving formal derivations, we should actually write out the $\\forall_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}} \\cdots$ on every line. This doesn't mean that $x^2 \\geq 0$ isn't a grammatical phrase, just that it is not the sort of thing which can appear by itself as a line in a proof. \n\nBut I haven't seen any references which do this, and you seem to be saying it is a bad idea for some reason. If you could flesh out why this is a bad idea, and help me understand the alternative, I'd appreciate it."
