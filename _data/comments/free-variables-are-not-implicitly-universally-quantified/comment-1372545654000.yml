message: "a) It was <em>E. W. Dijkstra</em> who pretended that he did not understand \"log(n)\" as an example of a function. (There is a link in my post, but I screwed it up by forgetting the closing tag, sorry.)\n\nb) There are more criteria to be considered when choosing notation;\nprecision and unambiguousness is just one aspect. Notation should also be concise, mnemonic, in line with tradition, not compete with other notations etc. Thus, I certainly don't agree that \"precise notation is better and should be used\" ABSOLUTELY and AT ALL TIMES.\n\nThere is a balance between convenience and precision. Phrases like \"We omit the subscript $S$ from $F_S(t)$ when it is clear from the context\" are abundant in the mathematical literature. Do you want to abolish them because this is \"sloppy\"? A book that I am reading proposes to render $f(x)(y)$ as $f(x,y)$ for the mere sake of saving parentheses.\nWhat is wrong with using a notation that is, strictly speaking, imprecise and ambiguous but is understood by everybody and causes no danger of confusion? There is a wide range of occasions for expressing mathematical ideas, ranging from dreams, the notes that we scribble, the blackboards that we write on when discussing with colleagues, over lectures, papers for publication to machine-checkable proofs. Different standards of rigor are appropriate for each category, but mathematical texts are written primarily for human readers and not for machines. \n\nc) Andrej, you still did not show how you propose to render my example with the $O$-notation. Let's see how it compares in terms of conciseness and awkward circumlocutions. I take it from your comments that you have never used the \"abominable O-notation\" to your advantage (and I hope I am not taking your comment in bad faith). Don Knuth has written elaborately on the O-notation, starting with his article \"<a href=\"http://www.phil.uu.nl/datastructuren/10-11/knuth_big_omicron.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">big Omicron and big Omega and big Theta</a>\".\n(And if you want a real challenge for your proposed replacement of the O-notation, take the passage at the bottom of p.22)\nConvenience comes at a price, and O-notation has its pitfalls, about which we can read, for example, in Volume 1 of the Art of Computer Programming. Maybe you don't regard Knuth as an authority because he uses expressions like \"functions $f(n)$\", but he has certainly spent a lot of conscious thought on this notation and on notation in general, and I think one thing that he cannot be accused of is \"laziness\".\n\nd) As far as I see, $\\lambda$-notation is nonexistent outside logic, foundations of mathematics and computing, computability and certain parts of programming. (I wonder how many of our mathematical colleagues are actually aware of what it means.)\nThe reason is, I believe, that mathematicians have seen little need for it, and when they did, have come up with ad-hoc notations, like $a_{i*}$ for the $i$-th row of a matrix, or $\\langle z,\\cdot \\rangle$ for partial evaluation of a bivariate function, that served them well enough. (Isn't there a similar notation, a standard one, on quantum mechanics?) I have a great respect for Dijkstra, but I don't like the self-opinionated attitude that is expressed at the end of EWD1151, trying to impose his personal standards of syntax on everyone. I am sensing a similar attitude in expressions like \"doing themselves a great disservice\". I might be convinced by an actual example from the literature where the confusion between the \"function $f(n)$\" and some particularly \"value $f(n)$\" causes some harm. We are tolerating the same confusion in the notation for polynomials. (But yes, there is the convention to use $X$ for indeterminates and $x$ when substituting values.)\n\ne) Andrey, I would still like to hear your opinion about my thesis that, <strong>by convention, we don't need to explicitly quantify all variables in a theorem BECAUSE they are implicitly universally quantified</strong>, in line with the peculiar characteristic of mathematics that its statements are universally true.\n(And why do we <em>want</em> to have all variables quantified? Because if variables remain free, the statement is not a proposition that could be true or false.)"
