  @Eduardo: it is possible to do away with <em>all</em> variables (look up
  "combinatory alegbra"), but humans are not good at using that sort of thing.
  As I said in the post, once you decide to have bound variables, you are more
  or less forced to have free variables as well. This is so because
  <em>inside</em> a universal quantifier $\forall x . \phi$ the variable $x$ is
  free. Or to put it in terms of computer science: a local variable is not
  visible outside of its scope, but inside its scope it acts as a free variable
  (one that is not "obsucred" and is "available"). You seem to think that free
  variables somehow complicate matters. They do not, bad math education and
  ignorance create confusion, and that complicates matters. Free variables are a
  completely natural concept. They reflect how humans speak and think. When you
  say "suppose $x$ is a real number", and then you proceed to argue about it,
  you have used a free variable. Mathematicians do that all the time.
