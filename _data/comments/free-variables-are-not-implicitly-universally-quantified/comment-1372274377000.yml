message: "Implicitly universal quantification is a good <b>convention</b> to have, in certain contexts, for example when formulating axioms or theorems. Trying to be consistent and precise at all times just makes life hard. The right balance between nit-picking and liberty is delicate and not always clear. But I believe it is all right and can cause no misunderstanding to say that $n+3k$ is a monotone function of $n$, without saying $n\\mapsto$ and without saying \"for all $k$\" (Hey, Andrey, I caught you! How is $k$ qualified?). Or even without saying \"of $k$\" if it is clear that $k$ is the quantity whose variation is under consideration. We can use the plain O-notation $O(n)$ if the context makes it clear whether we mean \"as $n\\to\\infty$\" or \"as $n\\to 0\" or something else, although the expression is, strictly speaking, meaningless without this qualification.\r\n\r\nAnother example came to my mind when I read Reason 2: (\"A similar sort of mistake happens in algebra where people think that polynomials are functions.\") Is the polynomial $x^2+2x+3 \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]$?  Is it in $\\mathbb{Z}[x,y]$? (Of course, both are true.) (Certain programming languages even have provisions for automatically \"promoting\" constants to constant functions if the context requires it.)\r\n\r\n2) You are using the expression \"a function in variable $x$\". Isn't this meaningless? Can you give an example of a function in variable $x$?"
