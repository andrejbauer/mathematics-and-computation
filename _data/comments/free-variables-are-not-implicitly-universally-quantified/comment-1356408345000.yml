message: "I think two things lead people astray on this, and are things that working with type theory sets you straight on.\r\n\r\nThe primary thing is that most mathematicians work in situations where all variables range over a single, non-empty domain of discourse, and bounded quantification is secondary. This means you don't have to worry about #4, say. Two is that, because every variable ranges over the same domain, they're just not put in the context (assuming you even work with a notion of context at all). This leads you to wonder what the status of free variables are, when free variables are 'obviously' bound by the context (and then their semantics become pretty clear, at least in the categorical treatment).\r\n\r\nThis also gets you the weird (to a type theorist): $(\\forall x. P(x)) \\Rightarrow \\exists x . P(x)$. \"What if you have an empty model?\" \"We've ruled those out, just because.\" The type theorist says instead: $y:A \\vdash (\\forall x:A . P(x)) \\Rightarrow \\exists x:A . P(x)$.\r\n\r\n(Oh, and to cover myself, those $A$'s and $P$'s are metavariables in a schema, not free variables; I think.)"
