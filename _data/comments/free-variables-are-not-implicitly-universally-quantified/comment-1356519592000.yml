message: "That \"a function is an expression in a context\" from point 2 makes me wonder why lambda calculus has lambdas at all rather than reinterpret function applications as suspended substitutions.\r\n\r\nThe representations of LC with explicit substitutions that I remember still have lambdas though, I guess for higher-order cases it's more convenient to have proper function types, especially when polymorphism is involved."
