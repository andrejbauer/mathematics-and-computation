  I am a math/CS nub, so please forgive me if what I am about to say is really
  stupid, BUT... Is it not easier to simply declare free variables evil, and
  force every variable to be bound to either a definition (an existential proof)
  or an universal quantifier? Would this not make the language simpler to
  understand?
