message: "Regarding the Universal Generalisation rule as it appears on the Wikipedia page to which you link, I am inclined to say that the reason why you consider that it is blatantly false is that it <b>is</b> false.  However, I cannot say this because too many traditional authors in logic use the $\\vdash$ notation in this way.\r\n\r\nJust as one deduces $\\vdash Q\\Rightarrow P$ from $Q\\vdash P$, so one should obtain $\\vdash \\forall x\\in Q.P(x)$ from $x:Q\\vdash P(x)$ and not from $\\vdash P(x)$.\r\n\r\nI am not sure how generally you propose to prepend $\\forall x$ to predicates with a free variable $x$, cf. Andrej's original comments.  It's technically correct in some cases.  However, it is <b>idiomatially</b> wrong: this is not how we write mathematics.  Specialists sometimes need to do things in idiosyncratic ways, but logicians have been notorious for doing this, to the extent that they end up talking about angels dancing on pinheads instead of the real (mathematical) world.\r\n\r\nAll of the difficulties with free variables, including the notorious Empty Domain fallacy ($\\forall x.P(x)\\vdash\\exists x.P(x)$), are solved by just <b>keeping track</b> of them, in a <b>context</b> (explicit listing), along with the propositional hypotheses.\r\n\r\nThis does not mean to say that we have to retain all of this accountancy while writing ordinary mathematical arguments.  Programming languages have developed good ways of indicating which variables are free (in scope) in any particular part of a program.  Similarly, there is the box notation for doing it in logical proofs.  However, there are also longstanding conventions for doing this in mathematical arguments written in natural language."
