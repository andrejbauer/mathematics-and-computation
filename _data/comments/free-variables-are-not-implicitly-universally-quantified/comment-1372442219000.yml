  What is wrong with $2^{O(n)}$? It is used not just by complexity theorists but
  all sorts of ordinary mathematicians and computer scientists who are
  describing the asymptotic growth of something. If $F$ is a function whose
  growth we want to study, should we really apply your suggested replacement
  instead of writing $F(n)\le 3n^2+7n+1=O(n^2)$?
