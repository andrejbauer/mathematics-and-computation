  I never said or pretended not to understand what it means to say that an
  expression is a function of some variable. I suggest you stop taking my
  statements in bad faith. What I am claiming is that precise notation is better
  and should be used. At the expense of two letters and one punctuation you can
  make the distinction between an expression and its abstraction perfectly
  clear. Surely you cannot argue in favor of sloppy notation?!
