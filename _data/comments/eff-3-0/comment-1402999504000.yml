  Resources are slightly more general. You can implemented references using
  resources, but you can also use resources for other "state-like" things. You
  can impement lazy values using resources, as well as persistent data
  structures and self-modifying structures, such as splay trees. Of course, you
  can do all of this if you have references, too. So in some sense resources and
  references are equally expressive. Note that there can also be
  <em>primitive</em> (builtin) resources that actually interact with the
  environment, such as streams of randomness, or communication channels.
