message: "@Dan: you raise an important question, and it is important to understand the answer: the equations <b>have no place</b> in Eff. The equations are about what is <b>expected</b> of a correct implementation, i.e., they are specifications. Equations do not tell us how to compute things (except in the lucky case when they can be directed so that they become reduction rules). How is Eff, or any other language, supposed to enforce equations?\r\n\r\nIn your concrete example, the relation between <code>Put</code> and <code>Get</code> is captured by the handler which handles them. There are many handlers, some of which satisfy the expected equations. Those can be said to be correct for the given equations. \r\n\r\nI do not undertand your last sentence about fuzziness."
