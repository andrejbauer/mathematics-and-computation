message: "Call me crazy, but I took the \"You can't do this in Java\" bet.\r\n\r\nHere it comes: The seemingly impossible Java-implementation of a seemingly impossible functional problem:\r\n<a href=\"http://github.com/untoldwind/seemingly_impossible\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/untoldwind/seemingly_impossible</a>\r\n\r\nOk, I just implemented the first three find's and I admit that this implementation is a sure way to exhaust the Java-Stack quite easily (if you get a StackOverflow running this stuff you might have to use -Xss512m or something).\r\nFor completeness I've added my own find-variant (FindJ), i.e. how would you solve this little problem in \"regular Java\", whatever that means (*cough* it's doing the examples above in &lt;1ms *cough*).\r\n\r\nNow, before the tomatoes fly: This is a hack! Also this is <b>not</b> about \"my language is better than yours\". Functional programming languages have their appeal and are able so solve certain types of problems in a very natural way, the Java-implementation is a syntactic mess in compassion.\r\nBut: I seriously doubt that there are problems you can only solve with a functional programming language.\r\nAfter all the Haskell compiler can not do magic, even though it might seem so sometimes."
