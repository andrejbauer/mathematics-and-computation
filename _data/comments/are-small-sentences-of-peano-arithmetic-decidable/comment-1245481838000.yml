  Yes, you misunderstand <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_completeness_theorem"
  rel="nofollow">G&ouml;del's Completeness Theorem</a>. The theorem guarantees
  that <b>valid</b> formulae are provable, not <b>true</b> ones. The difference
  is perhaps a bit subtle: a formula is valid when it holds in every model. A
  formula is considered true when it holds in a preferred model (referred to as
  the standard model).
