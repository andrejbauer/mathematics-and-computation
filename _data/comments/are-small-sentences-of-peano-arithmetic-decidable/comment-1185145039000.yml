  Primality is diophantine, but as far as I am aware the equation(s) expressing
  it involve many variables, which gives us many existential quantifiers, not
  just one. And even if somehow we could express "`n` is prime" with a single
  existential "`EE m. p(n,m)=0`", would that not still give us a `AA EE EE`
  sentence "for all `a` there exists `b` and exists `m` such that `p((a+b)^2 -
  2, m)=0`"? So I am afraid your comment does not convince me. (Note that Tung's
  result is about a single universal followed by a single existential.)
