  If the Paterek et al. paper interests you, you may find interesting
  undecidability I have found in the quantum formalism itself.  This derives
  from a logical excluded middle under the Field Axioms and relates to scalars
  whose logical status are distinct.  Some scalars exist as theorems of the
  Field Axioms, others merely satisfy them. Model Theory proves the
  undecidability. It then propagates fully throughout a theoremology indicative
  of causelogy in Nature that explains the "causal anomalies" of Quantum
  Physics. Some details are in my blog.
