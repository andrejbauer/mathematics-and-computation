  I'm having trouble seeing the non-trivial content of this paper. Associated to
  quantum systems there is an obvious notion of physical statements that are
  definitely true or false, or neither (ie. statements that are, or are not,
  eigenvectors of some measurement). In an axiom system we have provably true or
  false, or undecidable. Is it a big surprise that we can encode some simple
  examples of the latter into the former?
