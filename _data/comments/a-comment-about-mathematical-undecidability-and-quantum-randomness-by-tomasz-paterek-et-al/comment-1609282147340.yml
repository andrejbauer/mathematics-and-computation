message: "Textbook Quantum Theory is not complete.  In this there is a definite set of Postules that derive or prove a definite set of Theorems.  However, there are formulae in the mathematical language of Quatum Mechanics that those Postulates neither prove nor disprove.  These are known as Logically Independent. This logical independence is associated with mixed states only. And it permits a freedom, allowing the existence of mixed states, because Postulates do not prevent it; though neither do they cause it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe density operator or density matrix conveys probability information for all eigenstates of a quantum system’s full set of complementary variables. It plays a generative role in the creation of indefinite information.\r\n\r\nIn experiments, referential ambiguity is present in systems prepared as mixed states. This referential ambiguity is conveyed in the density operator.\r\n\r\nIt is important to understand that measurement hardware communicates with the density operator, not with the preparation history. Information passes from the preparation hardware into the quantum system’s density matrix; then from the density matrix to the measurement hardware. The density operator is the information carrier communicating between preparation and measurement; but due to referential ambiguity in the density operator, that communication is not one-one. As a quantum system is prepared to make a prepared state, its density operator evolves deterministically, resulting in a density operator determined by its preparation history. So, prior to measurement, the density operator is deterministic. But critically — for mixed states — the density operator does  not have a unique history. Hence, when a measurement asks the question: what history caused this density matrix? the answer is an ambiguous one.\r\n\r\nBy comparison, in the case of planets moving under gravity, questions asking: ‘What history caused this motion?’ would have definite answers; but for photon polarisation, the question: ‘What history caused this outcome?’ does not. The essential difference is that the planet does not need unitary symmetry to represent its motion, and so, does not convey the unitary symmetry’s associated referential ambiguity.\r\n\r\nNew book: \r\nThe Underlying Machinery of Quantum Indeterminacy: The Answer to a Century of Questions \r\n\r\nThis book is substantively based on the work of Paterek et al; and is an in-depth examination of Quantum Mathematics, for freedoms it imposes on Quantum Theory. Readers are given an exposition showing indeterminacy has origins in underlying mathematical processes; contradicting the view that quantum randomness is irreducible or predeterminated.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://quantum-indeterminacy.science/"
