message: "You can rephrase the theorem into a classically equivalent form that better exposes the constructive content.  The theorem may be stated as \"it is not the case that for every irrational a and b the number a^b is irrational\".  For suppose so.  Classically, root 2 is irrational, so by the assumption root 2 to the root 2 power is irrational.  So by the assumption again, root 2 to the root 2 to the root 2 is irrational.  But this is just 2, which is eminently rational.  Contradiction, and we are finished.\r\n\r\nThis is a perfectly constructive proof of a perfectly reasonable theorem (given that there is a constructive proof of the irrationality of root 2, which there is).  But it is not constructively equivalent to the problematic-sounding existence statement.  Classical mathematics treats the two forms of the theorem as completely interchangeable, but psychologically, at least, we know that they are not (because we can observe how people react when presented with one or the other form).  In any case they are not intuitionistically equivalent, and this is a good thing because intuitionistically there is a difference of computational content between the two theorems."
