  I see the proof of the above theorem in a somewhat different way than "a
  useless example of non-constructive proof". Let me make my point using a Car
  Analogy. You go to a car dealer, and he supplies a car to you, along with a
  guarantee: He must supply a -working- car to you, if needed. If you never use
  the car, the contract is implicitly satisfied, otherwise, if you do try to
  start the car, then two cases may occur: The car starts, and everything is
  fine, or the car does not start. In this case, you make use of your guarantee,
  and the dealer supplies a new, working car (or some other car with another
  guarantee). You do the same for your classical proof of existence of 2
  irrational numbers $a$ and $b$ such that $a^b$ is rational: act as if
  $a=\sqrt{2}$ and $b=\sqrt{2}$ satisfy your theorem. If anyone calls you out on
  it, by supplying a proof that $\sqrt{2}^\sqrt{2}$ is irrational, you can
  "backtrack" by supplying new witnesses to your theorem: $a=\sqrt{2}^\sqrt{2}$
  and $b=\sqrt{2}$. In a sense, the non-constructive proof does contain "less
  information" than the constructive proof. However it does supply a "guarantee"
  as in the above sense, that is you may use your witnesses with the caveat of
  perhaps needing to substitute them for "correct" witnesses at a further point.
