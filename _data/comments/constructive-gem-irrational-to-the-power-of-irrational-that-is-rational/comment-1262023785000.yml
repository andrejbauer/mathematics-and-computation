  But surely, it's a moot point?  $a = \sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$ is known to be
  irrational.  (Though I admit I haven't checked the constructive validity of
  the Gelfond-Schneider theorem.)  Moreover, I've never seen this famous
  "non-constructive proof" used as an argument against constructive logic before
  (I don't regularly read Wikipedia). It was presented to me as an interesting
  thought experiment about the nature of disjunction back when I was a student.
