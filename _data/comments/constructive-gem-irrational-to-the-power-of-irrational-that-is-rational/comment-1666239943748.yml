  In the constructive proof we show witnesses to the claim that there are two
  irrational numbers $$a$$ and $$b$$ such that $$a^{b}$$ is irrational, and we
  do this without using LEM. But this proof relies on the proposition that for
  any two real numbers $$a$$ and $$b$$, $$a^{\log{a}b} = b$$. Maybe we are using
  LEM in the proof of this proposition? Or did we actually compute the value of
  $$2^{\log_{2}3}$$ and found it to be 3? And also, what would be a constructive
  definition of logarithm? Is it an algorithm that computes $$\log_{a}b$$ for
  any real number $$a$$ and $$b$$? My point is, without some further
  clarification, the constructive proof looks just like a classical proof that
  picks out two numbers. It is not using LEM on the surface, but I am not sure
  if we have managed to avoid it completely; so I hesitate to call this proof
  constructive, and I know that this is a famous example of constructive proof.
