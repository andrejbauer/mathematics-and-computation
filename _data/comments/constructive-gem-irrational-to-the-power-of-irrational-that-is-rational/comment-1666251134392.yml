  @Koray: Of course this needs to be checked, but constructively exponentials
  and logarithms work as expected. For instance, "Foundations of Constructive
  Analysis" by Bishop & Bridges develops enough real analysis, and in particular
  of convergent power series, to show that there are no surprises.
