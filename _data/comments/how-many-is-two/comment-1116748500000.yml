message: "I disagree with the premis of this post.  It clearly the case that the cardinality of the set of equivalence classes of logically equivalent sentences is greater than two.  Even after you mod out by the axioms of ZFC, you still have sentences such as CH and Con(ZFC) which sit strictly between âŠ¤ and âŠ¥.  In fact this set forms a rich boolean algebra in classical logic.\nThe proof that &amp;not(&amp;notA&nbsp;&and;&nbsp;&not;&not;A) is straight-forward.  Assume that both &not;A and &not;&not;A are provable.  Then applying the first to the second we get a proof of âŠ¥ as required.  The proof in <a HREF=\"http://coq.inria.fr/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Coq</A> is:\n\n<pre>\nfun (A : Prop) (H : (A -&gt; False) /\\ ((A -&gt; False) -&gt; False)) =&gt;\nmatch H return False with\n| conj B C =&gt; C B\nend\n     : forall A : Prop, ~ (~ A /\\ ~ ~ A)\n</pre>"
