  Next, Hal (hello!) asks whether he is correctly interpreting constructive
  mathematics to mean "those things that can be computed" within the realm of
  classical mathematics. The answer is essentially "yes", with the caveat that
  this is not the only possible way of <em>interpreting</em> constructive math
  (for this is what Hal is doing, he is translating back into classical
  mathematics). Even more subtly, which things turn out to be valid in your
  interpretation depends on what exactly you mean by "implemented on a
  computer". With which programming language? (It matters!) This also requires
  an entire post to the blog.
