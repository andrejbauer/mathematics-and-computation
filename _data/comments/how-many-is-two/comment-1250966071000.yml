message: "Dear Yoav, the options you are mentioning are not valid within the context of this discussion.\n\n1. Preburger arithmetic is a very limited subset of Peano arithmetic which does not even contain multiplication. When we speak of <i>natural</i> numbers we mean Peano arithmetic. So, you have to consider all functions `f : NN -> 2` definable in Peano arithmetic, and it is impossible to decide whether such a function in general will always output `1` (actually, this already cannot be done for primitive recursive functions, which are a small subfamily of all number-theoretic functions). To put it in another way, of course by changing the assumptions you can draw a different conclusion.\n\n2. Tarski's axioms are for real closed fields, not natural numbers. The set of natural numbers is not definable in Tarski's theory. So your second remarks is not relevant because I was talking about function `NN -> 2`, not reals."
