message: "I'm a little late to the party, Andrej, but I wanted to ask....\n\nIn an intuitionistic type theory (say, HTT), Bool is clearly the strongly 2-elemented type.\n\nDoes this mean that Prop (the universe containing the unit type and the empty type) would be the weakly 2-elemented type? Wouldn't Prop also be the subobject classifier?"
