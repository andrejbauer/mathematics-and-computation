message: "Actually, I don't think having three logical values has much to do with getting `forall n in NN`. Rather, it has to do with the need to distinguish \"two in a weak sense\" and \"Two in a strong sense\". This, it seems to me, is an elaborate cirumlocution needed to keep some form of the law of the excluded middle while making a distincion between \"True\" and \"provably true\". \r\nBut this same kind of distinction can be made far more easily by rejecting the Law of the Excluded Middle as a universal law applying to all propositions and instead treating it as a contingent \"principle\" which applies to some propositions but not others. But this may not be the best place for this discussion.\r\n"
