  The failure of many rules of inference does appear to be of the strongest
  arguments against Lukasiewicz 3-valued logic. But apparently no one has
  noticed that it's possible to develop his logic in a way that does establish
  these rules of inference given certain reasonable conditions. My results have
  some features that are much like intuitionism. Since I'm an amateur with <a

  rel="nofollow">radically unorthodox</a> ideas and not an expert on
  intuitionistic logic, I'm interested in comparing them. Please bear with me.
