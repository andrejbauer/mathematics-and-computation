message: "I have understood the law of the excluded middle as having two classically equivalent formulations: bivalence (p v ~P) and noncontradition ~(p &amp; ~p). It appears to me that you are rejecting bivalence but accepting noncontradiction.\nI'm astonished to learn that I cannot have three logical values, since Lukasieiwicz invented his 3-valued logic in 1920, and I've been working with it for some 20 years myself. Could you reference the proof?\nIf you're talking about the proof in coq, I believe this is likely to include some implicit assumptions that I might not accept."
