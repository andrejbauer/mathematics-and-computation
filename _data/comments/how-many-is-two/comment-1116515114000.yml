  Thad suggests that maybe we can have three-valued logic and get `forall n in
  NN` that way. An important point I wanted to make was that it is a bad idea to
  think of constructive logic as being "three"-valued, since `Omega` has two
  elements in the weak sense (i.e., has no more than two elements). A better way
  of doing what Thad is suggesting would be not to try to get a third
  truth-value in, but to find a suitable subset `S sube Omega` which does the
  job. Such a subset, which will have to be larger than `2`, will have two
  elements in the weak sense.
