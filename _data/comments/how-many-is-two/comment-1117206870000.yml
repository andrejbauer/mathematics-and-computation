message: "\nYou are correct. Bivalence is not valid in intuitionistic logic, whereas noncontradiction is.\n\n\n\nThere is a lot of confusion about what it means to have two-valued logic (which is why I wrote this post). Lukasiewicz's three-valued logic is not a model of intuitionistic logic, because some rules of inference are not valid in it. I was not talking about just any arbitrary thing that anyone might call logic, but rather specifically about intuitionistic logic. But that does not matter since we can find models of intuitionistic logic which seemingly have \"three values\", for example the topos of presheaves on the category consistig of two objects and an arrow between them. In fact, given any Heyting algebra `H` with as many points as you like, you can find a model of intuitionistic logic, namely the `H`-valued sets, such that `Omega` is the set `H` (with a suitably defined `H`-valued equality predicate). But now it is important not to confuse the question \"How many points does `H` have?\" with the question \"<b>Inside</b> the model, how many points does `Omega` have?\". Inside the model you can prove the validity of the statement `not exists p in Omega . (p != TT and p != _|_)`, but in the metatheory you can easily find a Heyting algebra `H` with more than two points. Please do not confuse a theory with meta-theory.\n"
