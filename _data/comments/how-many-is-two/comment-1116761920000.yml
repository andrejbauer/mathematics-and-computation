message: "<p>\r\nI am not going to reply to every comment here, but please do not take that as a sign of my agreeing or disagreeing with you. This blog is not intended to be a tutorial in logic. I shall also write more specialist topics.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nReply to Thad: you cannot have three logical values. There is a proof of this. And if you read my post again, you will discover that I do reject the Law of Excluded Middle, and I do tell you how you can regain it by considering only the decidable propositions.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nReply to roconnor: you are confusing syntax and semantics. I was very careful to say that a truth value is represented by a sentence, but did not claim that <em>every</em> truth value can be represented by a sentence, which is an assumption implicit in your post. The Lindenbaum algebras you mention are made up of only those truth values that are definable, i.e., represented by some expression in the logic. Also, truth is not the same thing as provability. One last remark: what makes you think that in constructive mathematics every set has a cardinality?\r\n</p>"
