  This was definitely the most striking fact I remember from my class on
  constructive set theory that I took as an undergrad (when Michael Rathjen was
  visiting Stanford).  All I remembered in particular was that if the instance
  of the powerset axiom for a set of one element was true, then the entire
  powerset element would be.  Thanks for explaining just what's going on in more
  detail!
