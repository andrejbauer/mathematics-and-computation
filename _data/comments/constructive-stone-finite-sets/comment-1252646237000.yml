message: "This definition has always slightly puzzled me: not because it's too \"un-classical\", but because it's not \"un-classical\" enough --- in particular, I always get nervous when a definition gives 0 special treatment.  For instance, as you point out, we can prove \"every set is empty or inhabited\", i.e. \"every finite set has either at most 0 elements or at least 1\", but we can't prove analogous things like \"every finite set has either at most 1 element, or at least 2\" (we can see that this would imply excluded middle by considering the set {T,p} for any truth value p).\n\nOn a more practical note, I'd have expected that the same sort of phenomena (like looking at roots of polynomials) that give us finite sets in which we can't decide whether or not there are multiple distinct elements would also give us \"finite\" sets in which we can't decide whether there's any inhabitant at all?\n\nSo I'd rather see a more relaxed definition, something like:\n\nA set S is finite if there is some surjective _partial_ map from some natural number onto S.\n \nIs there a good way to see why this would be unsatisfactory, or why my worries about the standard definition are unfounded?"
