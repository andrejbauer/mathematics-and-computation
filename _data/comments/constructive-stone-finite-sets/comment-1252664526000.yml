  Peter (2): There are several notions of constructive finiteness. The one I
  wrote about is Kuratowski's notion, and it may be characterized as the free
  join-semilattice completion. The one you suggest ammounts to subsets of finite
  sets, and that is called <em>subfinite</em> (what is the categorical
  characterization?). You could restrict subfinite subsets to get a smaller (and
  more reasonable) class, for example the subsets of finite sets defined by
  `Pi_1^0` predicates are a possibility. Or you could take the intersection of
  the Kuratowski finite subsets with the compact subsets (with respect to a
  chosen dominance). There are indeed many possibilites, but the Kuratowski
  finite sets are the generally accepted "default" notion.
