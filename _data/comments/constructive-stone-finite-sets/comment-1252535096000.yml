  It might be nice to compare various notions of "finite set" from a
  constructive viewpoint, ie with respect to their computational content. 
  There's a huge (computational) difference between saying "here's a set and a
  natural number n such that i can map the set injectively into 0..n-1", and
  "... i can map 0..n-1 onto the set", and "no proper subset of this set can be
  mapped bijectively to this set".
