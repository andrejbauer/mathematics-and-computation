message: "Can you make a quick calculation that shows the cost of electricity is higher than hosting costs? I need a virtual private server because I want to run some special weird software (i.e., not just Wordpress but also custom executables).\n\nThe other worry I have is that a traffic cap might get in the way. For example, for around $25 I can get a virtual private server whose outbound traffic cap is 225GB/month. I have no idea whether my server delivers more traffic than that. I suspect the blog does not, but the random art site might. Also, I would use the server as a subversion repository, that's more traffic. And if I want remote backups, that's even more traffic (rsync goes both ways)."
