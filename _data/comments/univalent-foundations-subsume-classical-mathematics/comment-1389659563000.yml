message: "&gt;even though the HoTT book does not assume excluded middle or choice\n\nOf course, certain theorems do assume this, as part of their hypotheses.  You might mention this, as a definitive illustration of doing classical mathematics in HoTT.\n\n&gt;Apparently a mistaken belief has gone viral among certain mathematicians that Univalent foundations is somehow limited to constructive mathematics.\n\nThis belief is not only mistaken but downright incoherent.  One might as well say that the mistaken belief has gone viral that _constructive_ foundations is limited to constructive mathematics!  Of course, there are different varieties of constructive mathematics, but since Bishop's neutral attitude has grown to prominence, most people mean by ‘constructive mathematics’ something that is perfectly compatible with classical mathematics and which becomes classical mathematics upon adding the full axiom of choice (for sets).  It is classical mathematics that is limited!"
