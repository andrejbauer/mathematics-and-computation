  @Fran√ßois, have you considered a version of HoTT with a Mahlo Universe? If I
  remember correctly, Anton Setzer was able to identify a version of
  Kripke-Platek Set theory equiconsistent to intensional ML with one Mahlo
  universe, it would be plausible if classical HoTT with a Mahlo Universe were
  equiconsistent to ZFC with a Mahlo cardinal.
