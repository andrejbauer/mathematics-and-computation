message: "@Andrej: It's a subtle issue. Mike Shulman and I had a brief discussion about this <a href=\"http://dorais.org/archives/1438\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. The structure of universes in HoTT has a deep impact on the consistency strength. I had suggested using the minimalist \"any two types are in a common universe,\" and this alternative eventually got mentioned in the book.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the subtlety, take the issue of what the indices of the universes actually are, which was brought up in the discussion I linked to. If the indices are purely syntactic, i.e., we have a hierarchy of named universes $U, U', U'',\\ldots$ that continues for as many tick marks you can write, then that is essentially the minimalist formulation I proposed with a bunch of extra constant symbols. However, if the indices are elements of the natural number type, then the consistency strength shoots up a little. If formulated appropriately, the consistency of this Classical HoTT implies $\\forall n$ Con(ZFC + $n$ inaccessibles) and is therefore strictly stronger than the minimalist Classical HoTT.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, you get something different if you add $U^\\omega$ above all named universes $U,U',U'',\\ldots$ than if you have an $U^\\infty$ that has a $U:\\mathbb{N} \\to U^\\infty$ such that each $U(n)$ is a universe and every $A:U^\\infty$ belongs to some $U(n)$. In fact, you can get some very large cardinal strength by imposing richer structure for the universes...\r\n\r\nIn any case, the \"gap\" I mentioned is not an issue for HoTT. There is no reason to expect a <em>natural</em> set theory to be <em>exactly</em> as strong as Classical HoTT in consistency strength. The gap I mentioned is where the consistency of Classical HoTT is. If another theory pops up in this gap, it will be interesting to compare the two, until then, the gap is the end of the story. (More or less, the gap is actually not empty, which is why I said \"near the bottom.\")"
