message: "In the spirit of \"living up to your expectations\", let me just say that I think you should be careful with statements like \"in principle all classical mathematics could be so formalized\", because (obviously) practical mathematics really is a lot more than just classical logic + set theory.\n\nI've been reading Terence Tao lately, and greatly enjoy his take on foundational matters.  This is from the intro to his review of probability theory:\n<blockquote cite=\"http://terrytao.wordpress.com/2010/02/10/245a-notes-5-free-probability/\">\nAt a purely formal level, one could call probability theory the study of measure spaces with total measure one, but that would be like calling number theory the study of strings of digits which terminate. At a practical level, the opposite is true: just as number theorists study concepts (e.g. primality) that have the same meaning in every numeral system that models the natural numbers, we shall see that probability theorists study concepts (e.g. independence) that have the same meaning in every measure space that models a family of events or random variables.\n</blockquote>\nAnd this is from his notes on free probability:\n<blockquote cite=\"http://terrytao.wordpress.com/2010/02/10/245a-notes-5-free-probability/\">\nNote that this foundational preference is to some extent a metamathematical one rather than a mathematical one; in many cases it is possible to rewrite the theory in a mathematically equivalent form so that some other mathematical structure becomes designated as the foundational one, much as probability theory can be equivalently formulated as the measure theory of probability measures. However, this does not negate the fact that a different choice of foundations can lead to a different way of thinking about the subject, and thus to ask a different set of questions and to discover a different set of proofs and solutions. Thus it is often of value to understand multiple foundational perspectives at once, to get a truly stereoscopic view of the subject.\n</blockquote>\nI think the real value of the homotopy interpretation of type theory (and I'm sure you would agree :-) is that it adds stereoscopic depth to our understanding of logic and sets.  In my mind there is no need to add an \"and everything you can do HoTT can do better, in principle\"."
