message: "@Andrej: I'm aware about availability of a ZFC model in HoTT (as well as the classical CZF model in any MLTT, due to Aczel). Depending on what universes are being postulated, there are apparently even bi-interpretability results. But how do we know the given model is a proper embedding? (Such one that the statements provable about the objects of the model and expressible in ZFC-language are exactly the same as the provable ZFC statements?)\n\nIt's not clear to me why it should be that way. I'm thinking of T = ZFC + {existence of some inaccessible cardinal ?}, it has a model V_{?+1} of ZFC which is at the same time a model of Morse-Kelley Set Theory. Clearly, the T-provable statements about the objects of the model is at least equal to the set of MK-provable statements and this strictly larger than the set of ZFC-provable statements.\n\nThe existence of a conservative model is quite essential for the second part of the question, namely the conjectured fact that any structurally-relevant construction that can be carried out by set-theoretical means, can also be carried out without them."
