message: "Addendum: I've now mostly convinced myself that the consistency of Classical HoTT (as formulated in the book) is precisely equivalent to the $\\Pi_1$-statement $\\forall n$Con(ZFC + \"there are at least $n$ inaccessibles\"). One direction was discussed above and in more detail <a href=\"http://dorais.org/archives/1532\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. The converse requires a little bit of trickery...\r\n\r\nUsing compactness, we can get a model of ZFC with a nonstandard natural number $n$ and at least $n$ inaccessibles. Working in this model of ZFC, the simplicial set construction gives a model of type theory with a chain of $n$ univalent universes. Stepping outside this nonstandard model of ZFC, we can forget about the universes indexed by nonstandard numbers and we get a full model of Classical HoTT. Note that the natural numbers $\\mathbb{N}$ of this model of Classical HoTT are the same as those of our nonstandard model of ZFC. Thus this argument exploits the very important fact that the universes in HoTT (as formulated in the book) are <em>not</em> indexed by the internal $\\mathbb{N}$."
