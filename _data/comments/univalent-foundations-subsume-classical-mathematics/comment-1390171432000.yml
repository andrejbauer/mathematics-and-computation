message: "@Alexander: I agree. Universe reflection principles, which is how I would categorize Setzer's Mahlo universe, are potentially very useful and they illustrate the need for \"large universe hypotheses.\"\r\n\r\nIt's tempting to think that these are only useful for more esoteric purposes. However, I've been to several set theory talks where the speaker said something like: \"this is a simple property of subsets of sets of reals, it shouldn't have anything to do with large cardinals.\" It's only a matter of time until the same kind of thing is said in a HoTT talk."
