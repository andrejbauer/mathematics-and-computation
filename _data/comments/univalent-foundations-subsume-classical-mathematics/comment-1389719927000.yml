  @Neel: where did I state that constructivists accept choice for all types? I
  said they would <b>ask</b> about choice for all types, because there is a
  version which holds in type theory, but it is misleading to call that one
  "choice" in the presence of normal mathematicians. And we are in their
  presence.
