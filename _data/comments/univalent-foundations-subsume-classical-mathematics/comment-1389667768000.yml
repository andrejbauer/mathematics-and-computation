message: "I had quit following that discussion on the list but I'm glad you brought it back to my attention with this post. I really like this post, Andrej.\r\n\r\nThe greater underlying issue is that you have to be careful how you say things in HoTT. But this is not a new issue: you have to be careful how you say things in all of mathematics. Mathematicians are very familiar with this issue but they are not (yet) familiar with how it plays out in HoTT. Fortunately, mathematicians are well trained at this task. Consciously or not, learning how to correctly handle the vocabulary is one of the very first things one does when approaching a new subject.\r\n\r\nI like this post because it emphasizes what you need to be careful with and how to be careful about it when formulating certain things in HoTT. It's not a simple right/wrong issue: it's about how to correctly say what you mean in general. I think this post will actually help the reader to develop some of the reflexes necessary to correctly handle propositions, sets, and other types in HoTT, which are infinitely more valuable skills than just knowing the right formulation of AC and LEM.\r\n\r\nBy the way, wouldn't it be great if there were some simple examples of higher level types that aren't from topology? I think a compelling example like that would do a lot to promote HoTT."
