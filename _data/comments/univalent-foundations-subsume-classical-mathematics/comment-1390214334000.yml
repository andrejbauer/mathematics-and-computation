message: "François asks:\r\n\r\n<blockquote cite=\"\">By the way, wouldn’t it be great if there were some simple examples of higher level types that aren’t from topology? I think a compelling example like that would do a lot to promote HoTT.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThorsten Altenkirch gave a nice <a href=\"http://smc2014.univ-lyon1.fr/doku.php?id=week1\" rel=\"nofollow\">talk</a> last week about how the presence of HITs enhances the notion of container/polynomial functor.\r\n\r\nHere's a simple example. The walking example of a polynomial functor is that of words, i.e., $W(X) = \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} ([n] \\to X)$, where $[n]$ denotes the inductive type with $n$ constructors. Usually, an example beyond the reach of polynomial functors is that of finite multisets, i.e., sequences of elements of $X$ up to reordering. \r\n\r\nNow let $\\mathbb{P}$ denote the HIT defined just like $\\mathbb{N}$, but with an identity $n = n$ for each permutation of $[n]$. You get multisets as $M_f(X) = \\sum_{p \\in \\mathbb{P}} ([p] \\to X)$.\r\n\r\nThis is of course a type-theoretic reworking of Joyal's ideas on species, and $\\sum$ is really a coend in the last formula."
