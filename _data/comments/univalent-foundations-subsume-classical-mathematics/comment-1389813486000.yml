message: "Regarding Alexander's questions. My understanding is as follows; I hope it is correct. My understanding of the simplicial set model is limited, so I hope that experts will chime in to confirm and/or correct.\n\nIn terms of consistency, ZFC + infinitely many inaccessibles proves the consistency of Classical HoTT (HoTT with AC and hence LEM) via the simplicial set construction. On the other hand, for every n, Classical HoTT proves the consistency of ZFC + at least n inaccessibles via the methods of chapter 10 in the book. There is a gap between the two but it is a rather small one and the consistency of Classical HoTT appears to be near the bottom of this gap.\n\nIn terms of conservativity, this is much more subtle because of the vast differences between the languages of ZFC and (Classical) HoTT. The problem is that conservativity is about certain classes of statements in a specified language and different choices lead to different conservation results; thus \"HoTT is conservative over ZFC + ...\" is not completely meaningful without such context. One plausible way of obtaining such a statement is to show that by carrying out the chapter 10 constructions inside the simplicial set model constructed in an ambient model $V$ of ZFC + infinitely many inaccessibles, one can recover the (relevant) $V_\\kappa$'s of the ambient model. This seems likely but I cannot be certain since I don't have a sufficient understanding of the simplicial set model to verify. In any case, that would lead to some kind of conservativity results.\n\nIt's hard to find all of this, are these issues explicitly addressed somewhere in the HoTT literature?"
