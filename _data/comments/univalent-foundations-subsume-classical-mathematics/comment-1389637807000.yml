  It's worth mentioning that the situation with "the axiom of choice for all
  types" is a bit more complicated than that.  It's true that one obvious
  statement which might go by that name, namely "every surjection has a
  section", is inconsistent with univalence.  However, there are other versions
  of AC that say something about types of arbitrary level but are consistent
  with univalence.  For instance, there is the traditional propositions-as-types
  AC, which far from being inconsistent is just <i>true</i> (as famously
  observed by Martin-Lof).  There are also the statements considered in Exercise
  7.8 of the HoTT Book, which are (apparently) stronger than AC-for-sets but at
  least some of which are consistent with univalence.
