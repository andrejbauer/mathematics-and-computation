message: "The statement <em>“Univalent foundations subsume classical mathematics!”</em> begs for a concrete result: Recovering ZF and ZFC/NBG inside HoTT.\n\nIt's known that a material set theory is a topos + <abbr title=\"directed structural system of inclusions\">dssi</abbr> [<a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.185.2522&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Awodey, Butz, Simpson, Streicher '2007</a>], so one could try to show that given a dssi for a particular universe of sets MatSets, the language of material set theory can be naturally interpreted and HoTT is a concervative over CZF/IZF/ZF/ZFC (depending on wether we accept Propositional resizing, LEM for Prop and AC for Set) regarding MatSets. Using the notion of class category, one could probably reconstruct the language of NBG and find a HoTT axiom reassembling NBGs Limitation of Size*, that renders HoTT conservative over NBG. But that's the easy part.\n\nThe hard part is to show that advanced all set-theoretic constructions (such as Stone–?ech compactifications, GNS-constructions, weird ultrafilters etc.) can be carried out without using material set theory. The proper formulation would be something like “if a category in its material (MatSet) version admits some universal construction, the structural (“non-evil” in n-cat-lab parlance) version also admits this universal construction.”\n\n(* Limitation of size Axiom of NBG has a highly appealing form: it's a statement allowing “maximal impredicativity” equivalent to the assumption that every category has a basis, i.e. can be represented as a strict category. What's the analogon for HoTT?)"
