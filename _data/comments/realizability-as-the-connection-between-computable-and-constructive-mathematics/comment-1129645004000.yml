message: "Hi Andrej,\n\nI've read the revised Section 2. I think it is much clearer right now. I'm glad that my comments helped you correct a theorem. \n\nI would however, as a computer scientist, love to see a reference for the footnote 2. Why did you pick out this particular sense of convergence, it is not clear to me. Why \"write-only\"? Which class of computable numbers in the literature does this correspond to? (Some of them were mentioned in the h-monotonicity paper that I sent the link of) What happens if you take another sense of convergence?\n\nAlso missing (it seems) that the effective variation of Type II computability is identical to Type I computability. In fact, then you might want to say that Type II computability has two variations, rather than three. (?)\n\nAs another remark, you change the domain and co-domain of the function, which is nice. But I don't see why you don't change the sense of convergence (or why you change it in only a limited sense). Let me briefly commently on this and you can check for yourself it it makes any sense. :)\n\nThe rapid convergence criterion that you used in Type I and Type II computable real is the classical definition of a computable real, e.g. effective computability. But there are, for instance, monotonically converging procedures, that converge so slowly, that you can't put a time bound on the next digit to be output (the approximation procedure for Chaitin's Omega was like that if I'm not mistaken). So the def'n for Type I wouldn't include these (again IIRC and if I'm not mistaken!).\n\nIf we return to the footnote 2, you seem to want to get rid of the limitation of rapid convergence in Type II computable function, is that true?\n\nBut then I would have two questions:\n  1. Why aren't you saying that this is computability in the limit, rather than classical computability? (Class of semi-computable reals, etc.) Is this something different in footnote 2? Is \"write-only\" there to prevent computability in the limit, once a digit is output it can't be read,  forever. Why is that so important? Why can't a machine that has unlimited time, go back and and read what it wrote, and re-write that digit? Because it already has infinite input, it can read magical numbers like Omega as input, why can't it do something that ordinary computers can do already?\n\n  2. Why aren't you using this different sense of \"computable sequence\" of Type II computable function directly in the definition for a Type III computable real number, or something like that?\n\nI would be grateful if you could clear my mind about these questions.\n\nRegards,\n\n--\nEray Ozkural, miserable phd student\n\nPS: I am assuming that footnote \"2\" does change the meaning of \"computable sequence\". It is more loose than the usual rapid convergence criteria of the Cauchy sequence. Am I not right?"
