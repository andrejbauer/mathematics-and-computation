message: "If you really mean constructive <i>set theory</i>, then I would recommend <a href=\"http://www.mittag-leffler.se/preprints/meta/AczelMon_Sep_24_09_16_56.rdf.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">\nNotes on Constructive Set Theory</a> by <a href=\"http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~petera/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Peter Aczel</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amsta.leeds.ac.uk/Pure/staff/rathjen/rathjen.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Michael Rathjen</a>. It should be easier to learn constructive set theory from this than from seminal work. If, however, by \"constructive set theory\" you really mean constructive <i>mathematics</i> then the book to read is definitely \"Constructive Analysis\" by Erret Bishop and Douglas Bridges. It's the constructive mathematics bible."
