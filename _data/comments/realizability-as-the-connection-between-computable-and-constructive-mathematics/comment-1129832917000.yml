message: "Hi Andrej, thanks for these answers. There is just one thing that is not clear to me (yet). So I think you say that the Type II machine with the \"write-once\" requirement does not correspond to monotonically converging computable real numbers. That is, I suppose,  a larger class of reals, then. (And indeed, one does not need to defend by giving separate arguments why rapid convergence is good enough, it turns out!)\r\n\r\nYour remarks about the computation of the mathematical structure are quite interesting and thought-provoking, as well! Even to somebody who is only a beginner in category theory like me, I have seen how this is done in the paper. Would you care to post a few words on the  significance of such a computation? I would like to forward that remark to our humble philosophy group which has some well known AI researchers, and I would definitely love to see you there if you'd care to join.\r\n\r\nFor instance, is it relevant to AI? I find the thesis of the paper quite interesting, that you can *derive* computable mathematics by a certain *representational* interpretation of constructive mathematics. Which sounds as if this would be the rational/epistemologically preferable thing to do. What implications do you think this connection might yield for foundational issues?"
