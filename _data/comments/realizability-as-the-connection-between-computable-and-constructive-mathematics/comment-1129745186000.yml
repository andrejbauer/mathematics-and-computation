message: "I understand. Thus once a digit is decided it is decided, otherwise we would have allowed oscillating computations that don't converge. I had read about such write-once infinite output machines in Schmidhuber's work (a famous AI researcher) and in some papers on computable numbers (but I don't have the best memory so I can't say exactly where :) ). I still haven't gotten around to digesting Weihrauch's book. I'm sure it will be an interesting read. There is always a world that I don't know. I didn't even know Weihrauch's name two weeks ago.\r\n\r\nExcuse me for my endless nitpicking but, isn't your revised definition of comment 9. equivalent to monotonic convergence as I say in comment 8.? Or what am I missing? I would be interested in understanding this detail.\r\n\r\nYou have also encouraged me to read the sections after 3 more carefully. :) I am trying to understand the significance of this metamathematical approach using category theory (right way to say it?), it seems to better defined than the classical debates.\r\n\r\nThanks for answering my comments.\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\n\r\n--\r\nEray Ozkural"
