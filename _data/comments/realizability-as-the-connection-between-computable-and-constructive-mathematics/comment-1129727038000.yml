message: "A reference to footnote 2, which explains briefly how a Type II machine is supposed to perform its infinite computation, is Klaus Weihrauch's book \"Computable Analysis\". There the motivation for this definition is given. I also give a bit more detail about it in a later section when I formally define Type II computability.\n\nI see now that I made another mistake. Instead of saying that a Type II machien has a \"write-only\" output tape I should have said that it has \"write-once output tape\". That is, once it writes something in a cell, it cannot change it. It can of course read its own output, if it so pleases, but this is irrelevant, as it has a working tape on which it can store a readable copy of its output. The motivation for \"can write only once\" is that we want to be able to know what the output is. If the machine were allowed to write some output and change later, we would never be sure it has written out the final answer."
