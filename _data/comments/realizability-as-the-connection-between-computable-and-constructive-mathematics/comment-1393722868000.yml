message: "I happened upon these lecture notes of yours today and found them a nicely informative and enjoyable read. There are now a dozen or so nLab entries citing them...\n\nBy the way, vaguely related to this I am wondering if your contribution to the book collection \"A Computable Universe: Understanding and Exploring Nature as Computation\" by Zenil is available in electronic copy? I'd very much like to have a look (Google Books shows only the first handful of pages of your chapter) or else know what your main claim or punchline there is."
