message: "Andrej, I haven't looked at the updated version yet, but I fail to see how the definition of a computable sequence as you have just described in comment 4 is different from the Effectively Computable class of real numbers (i.e. Turing's definition). It had seemed to me that your intention was to identify the class EC with Type I, and Type II with something else. I, intuitively, can see no difference between the identities of a particular computable sequence, and the unique program that generates it. I shall have another look at the revised version when I have time since you say it will clarify my question.\n\nRegards,\n\nhttp://myspace.com/malfunct"
