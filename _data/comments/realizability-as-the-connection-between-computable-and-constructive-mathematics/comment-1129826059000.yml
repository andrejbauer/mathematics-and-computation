message: "Further answers to remark 8: Type I and the effective version of Type II are <em>not</em> equivalent. In Type I the machine has access to a <em>program</em> while in Type II it only has access to the output of a program. It can be shown that this difference is sufficient to make Type I and Type II inequivalent.\r\n\r\nNo, I do not want to remove the condition of rapid convergence of Cauchy sequences in the definition of reals. The time it takes for a machine to compute the next bit of output has nothing to do with how we describe reals. The point of rapid convergence is not how quickly we can compute approximations to the real, but rather how much information we obtain every time we compute the next term in the Cauchy sequence.\r\n\r\nLet me emphasize something here: the correct definition of reals, as well as the correct definitions of every other structure we want to compute with (functions, distributions, etc.) is not something that we need to discover, or to use ingenuity to get at. It is something we can <em>compute</em> using standard category-theoretic interpretation of logic in the category of reprentations. This is a main theme of the notes. So I do not really feel it is necessary to defend the definition of reals, as it is simply computed (we may discuss whether I made a computational error, though). Of course, this is a cool \"high-level\" computation where the \"unknown\" is a mathematical structure rather than a single number."
