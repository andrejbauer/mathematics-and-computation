message: "Thank you for your comments, Andrej. It's quite hard to learn about constructivism in Turkey, so your help is much appreciated. \n\nWe have been trying to understand a point in your paper in the yahoo group ai-philosophy . It might be due to our unfamiliarity with the intricacies of computability theory. (So excuse me if I come off ignorant) However, there is at least one thing that I do not understand.\n\nIn definition of Type II computability, you say that this is the definition of a computable real number. First, I am not sure what you mean by a computable sequence. I would ordinarily understand the same thing as Type I. Failing that, I would understand something akin to \"computability in the limit\" (i.e. finite program-size, infinite running time, infinite tape, no guarantee when a symbol will be written, but the output \"converges\" to the desired output in the limit).\n\nYou say that \"Type II representation differs from Type I also in that it can be used to represent any real number, and not just a computable one\". By this place, I change my mind into that you just mean each a_k/b_k are computable (by definition since they are rational?), and you mean an actually infinite tape which is basically isomorphic to the usual definition of a real number. But here is where I am lost. If I can represent any real number using Type II representation, then uncomputable reals, uncountably many of them, are included in this set. How can Type II be a definition of computability then? What am I misunderstanding?\n\nAgain, please excuse me if I am being stupid. I am very interested in theory, and I am just trying to learn.\n\nRegards,"
