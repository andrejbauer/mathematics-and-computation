  You are absolutely correct. This is a good constructive proof that there
  exists a non-r.e. subset of N. I have no idea what I was thinking when I wrote
  my comment. As you noticed, we need to make the statement stronger: "Prove
  that there is a function `NN -> {0,1}` (defined <em>everywhere</em> on `NN`!)
  which is not computed by any Turing machine". In your proof, pinpoint the use
  of classical logic. (Note: it is possible to avoid classical logic in this
  case by using non-classical Brouwerian axioms. But you cannot prove the
  statement straight in constructive mathematics because constructive
  mathematics is consistent with Formalized Church's Thesis.)
