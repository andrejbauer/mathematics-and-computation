  The idea of developing computability theory from a strictly logical or set
  theoretical point of view is fascinating and, if by 'elegant' you mean 'using
  fewer symbols', then certainly this is more elegant than the classical
  approach.  But I'm bewildered by the terse notation; I feel like someone who's
  always programmed in Cobol trying to understand a C program.  So I'm
  wondering, 1) what kind of background is needed to appreciate the lecture
  notes, and 2) can a similar theory be developed using classical logic, or
  would that just degenerate back into classical recursion theory?
