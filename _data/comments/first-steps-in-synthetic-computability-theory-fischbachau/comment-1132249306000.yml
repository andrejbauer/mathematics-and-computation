message: "I'm not entierly sure if I agree with your notion of elegance.  Certainly Godel numbering and all that crap are a big pain in the ass to learn but once they are learned one never uses them.  However, it is frequently very helpful to think of what is going on as a real computation or some kind of coding.  Thus at some point it seems necessery that everyone be expoused to Godel numberings and the like, if for no other reason than to prove this system does the same thing as we intuitively expect a computer to do.\r\n\r\nSo seperating things into the two categories I'm not sure I see the elegance advantage.  Since I'm studying recursion theory I'm probably biased toward finding the current practice pleasent but by ignoring details about coding and having a good grasp of what details we can wave away we end up with a very elegant practice.  In fact I think it is far more elegant than almost every other branch of mathematics preciscely because one almost never has to deal with annoying details (well less so).\r\n\r\nNow I certainly agree all the cruft one goes through while learning recursion theory is ugly crap.  However, if people are going to need to know this anyway so they can move to the next level of ignoring these details then there isn't much we can do to get rid of it.  In other words it seems like an elegant approach in need of an audience.  Though perhaps I misunderstand what your goal is.\r\n\r\nThis isn't to say I didn't think your paper made a very interesting and perhaps usefull contribution.  In particular I would be fascinated to know if this approach can be extended to work with various extensions of recursion theory to other structures such as search computable, prime computable and several other notions.  This, I think is where this sort of elegant abstract approach is particularly appropriate.\r\n\r\nOne thing I was a bit confused on was what you meant by P 1.  I assume the P is supposed to be power set and the 1 is just the standard ordinal definition of 1.  Yet wouldn't this just be {0,1}.  I presume I am missing something in the intuitionism framework but I would appreciate a hint.\r\n\r\nP.S. Don't listen too much to my elegance complaints.  The people who learned the old system never like the new one."
