  Thanks for your response.  I'm having a hard time wrapping my mind around
  this.  Since I understand classical computability theory (or at I think I do;
  I'm starting to have doubts), my difficulty must come from not knowing
  constructive mathematics/intuitionistic logic.  Could you recommend a tutorial
  or a text (at a beginner's level) that will get me started?
