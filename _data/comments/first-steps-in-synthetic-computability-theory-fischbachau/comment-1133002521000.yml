message: "Deprogramming oneself from classical logic is not easy. In my experience it takes a couple of years. As for an introductory text in constructive logic, I am not sure what to recommend. For example, Troelstra and van Dalens \"Constructivism in Mathematics\" is very exhaustive and explains well the ideas, but is written by logicians for logicians. Or you might try Beeson's book. Bishop and Bridges \"Constructive Analysis\" is another option--it is after all the constructivist bible. But they simply <em>do</em> constructive mathematics, without explaining much how to do it. In fact, this may be the best approach: just jump into the constructivist swimming pool and hope there is water in it.\n\nPerhaps the following exercise will help: prove that there exists a subset of `NN` which is not recursively enumerable. Precisely where did you use classical logic in that proof? Probably it was something like \"either `n in W_n` or not.\" Now try proving it without this step (you will fail). Welcome to constructive mathematics."
