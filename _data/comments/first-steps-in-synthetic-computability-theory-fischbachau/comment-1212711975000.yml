message: "(Sorry, I know this is a very old comment to reply to, but it caught my eye)\n\nDid you mean to say \"prove there exists an element of 2^N which is not recursively enumerable\" instead, or have some particular constructive system in mind more restrictive than intuitionistic logic? To be explicit, it seems to me the following serves as an intuitionistically acceptable proof that there exists a non-r.e. subset of N:\n\nLet Halt(a, b) mean that the program coded by a halts on input b. Consider {x | ~Halt(x, x)}. If this were r.e. (i.e., semidecidable), then there would be some p such that Halt(p, x) is equivalent to ~Halt(x, x) for all x. But then, Halt(p, p) would be equivalent to ~Halt(p, p), a contradiction (even intuitionistically). Thus, we can conclude, {x | ~Halt(x, x)} is non-r.e.\n\nThe only thing which we wouldn't be able to do intuitionistically, it seems to me, is go on to conclude that this set has a 2-valued characteristic function. I'm almost certain you just made a small typo, but just in case not, have I missed some flaw in the above ostensibly constructive proof?"
