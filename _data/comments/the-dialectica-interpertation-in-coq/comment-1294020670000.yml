message: "Nice post, Andrej, and I agree with your prognosis for the field.\r\n\r\nA technical point: please do not use the phrase \"HOAS\" for \"I managed to encode my syntax using some sort of functions somehow or other, even though it is inadequate to do so\".  Your encoding is NOT a use of higher-order abstract syntax!  It is, rather, some cockamamie thing that you came up with that then has to be tamed in order to make it sort-of work in the situation at hand.  Put in other terms, you're using a negative function space, rather than the correct positive function space, so that your encoding of syntax is precisely not HOAS.  It's just confusing for people to perpetuate this myth/mistake!\r\n\r\nBob"
