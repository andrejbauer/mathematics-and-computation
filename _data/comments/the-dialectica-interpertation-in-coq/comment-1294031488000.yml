  I think what Andrej meant was PHOAS (parametric higher-order abstract syntax).
  It is a clever way of simulating HOAS by universally quantifying the type of
  variables. See a <a href="http://adam.chlipala.net/papers/PhoasICFP08/"
  rel="nofollow">paper by Adam Chlipala</a> for its introduction. HOAS is, of
  course, not possible in Coq.
