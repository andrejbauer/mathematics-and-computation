message: "It would be easier to follow comments on your weblog with some sort of software infrastructure.  Am I missing something?\r\n\r\n<i>Is there a better name for what I did other than “cockamamie thing that I came up with”?</i>\r\n\r\nHow about CHOAS as the umbrella term, for Cockamamie Higher-Order Abstract Something-or-other?  Then you could perhaps call your representation LF-style CHOAS."
