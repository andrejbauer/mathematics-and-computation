message: "@Bob: You are quite right, this is not HOAS. Is there a better name for what I did other than \"cockamamie thing that I came up with\"? I think the Coq people call it \"deep embedding\" sometimes. But there are different \"depths\". HOAS is \"deeper\" than what I did. Anyhow, I edited the post.\n\n@Matija: We (you and I) tried PHOAS a while ago, as you will remember, but in the end there seemed to be no real advantage.\n\nBy the way, the troubles with unwanted dependencies proved to be useful. Coq (or shall I say type theory) pointed clearly towards a fully dependent version of Dialectica in which <code>C p</code> depends on <code>W p</code> (I have to work out the details before saying more about it). So the cockamamie thing was good for something!\n"
