message: "This is a lot of work to do, on both sides, and I guarantee nobody's going to work this way. The idea, however, is of course correct. Here are some UI suggestions, based on your observation that we're talking about code here.\r\n\r\nIn the world of non-formalized-mathematics software projects, there are known practices such as continuous integration servers and cloud deployment and virtual machines, to remove the burden of all these administrative tasks done by hand. For example, it is standard practice to do something like set up a GitHub project and link it to Travis. This is just the tip of an iceberg, of course. Basically, if code for research papers is to be taken seriously, the entire process of developing it and sharing it and replicating it should be taken seriously, as seriously as developing a commercial Web app."
