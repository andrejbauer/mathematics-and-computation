message: "You write that mechanized proofs must be subject to as rigorous review as pen-and-paper proof. But just how carefully are the latter currently being reviewed? In informal discussions, I have heard several computer scientists say that when they review they often don't have time to check the proofs and  just take the theorem statements on faith... \n\nAt venues like POPL the common practice is to put all the proofs into technical reports (which the reviewers usually have to track down themselves if they wish to read them), and the instructions for submission say that reviewers are only obliged to look at the paper, not the supporting material.\n\nWell, hopefully the increasing use of mechanized proofs should be helpful here. As you say, even when the compilation trouble is factored in, it's a lot less work to verify the correctness of a mechanized proof than a pen-and-paper proof."
