message: "[I realize this is over two years old.] At first I agreed with Andrej.  Then reading Dan Ghica's replies changed my mind.  My first reaction to his replies was that the post addressed Dan's concerns and clearly gave motivation, but as I read and thought more, I realized Dan was right.  Andrej is working from an incorrect premise that may be true only transitionally.  In fact, in my opinion, Dan underestimates the reality. Literate programming is irrelevant.\n\nProofs will be (and always were) software.  What's new is they will start having real clients.  \"Proofs are sacred!\" is nice to say, but it was never actually practiced.  Mathematicians cared about pretty and persuasive arguments which often referred to things labelled \"proofs\".  Only now are proofs actually being created and they aren't sacred, they're <i>valuable</i>.  Programmers are going to be using these things to machine check that their airfoil simulation code actually accurately simulates the mathematical model.  Other mathematicians are going to be using Coq et al and are going to be using exact real libraries.  They aren't going to rewrite that stuff every time.  Proofs are going to be upgraded.  You will have Heine-Borel v1.3.4.  There's little need to preserve Heine-Borel v0.1.  Virtually no one is going to care about a published paper.  The proof will be in use before any paper is published.  Papers will still be published, just as papers are published about software.  But no one reads those papers to decide if the code actually works.  I don't care if your proofs prove what your paper says they do; I care if they prove the premise of my theorem.  The Millenium problems will be propositions awaiting their proof terms. Indeed, often the theorems to be proved will be fixed before some would-be author even decides to attempt to prove it.  They'll be Feature Requests.\n\nAs a minor reprieve, elegance/beauty will still be valued, but probably much less so...  A less minor reprieve is mathematics will probably get a lot more funding and interest."
