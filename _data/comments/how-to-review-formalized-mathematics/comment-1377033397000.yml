  I did not discuss at all how to make sure that the mechanized proofs can still
  be checked a couple of decades from now. I think that is a separate (and
  important) issue that must be solved as well. Putting things on arxiv.org is
  of course a good idea, but I focused on the review process, so that is kind of
  irrelevant for this post.


  But I do insist that a reviewer cannot simply trust the authors that they
  mechanized the proofs correctly. Are you saying that at conferences such as
  POPL people review papers and just blindly trust the authors when they claim
  the proofs have been formalized?
