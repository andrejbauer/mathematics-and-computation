  I think Andrej did make clear that a big part of the work he did was to verify
  the correspondence between the human-language description of the problem, and
  the formalized problem.  It's all very well to have a program that compiles
  and runs without crashing, but we also want to be sure that the way we first
  construed its purpose is reliably what it actually does.  That part of the
  review cannot be machine-verifiable, because it is dependent upon what is not
  mechanical.
