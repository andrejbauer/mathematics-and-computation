  @Franklin: I agree that the burden of independently compiling the code could
  be made a bit lighter by good infrastructure. But I still think that the
  reviewer needs to see with his own eyes that the code compiled. And you say
  that's a lot of work. Well, reviewing <em>is</em> a lot of work, when done
  honestly. All in all, I would say the total amount of work in checking
  formalized mathematics will be smaller than with checking informal
  mathematics. After all, you just need to check that they correctly formulated
  the definitions and theorems (something you do automatically when reviewing
  informal mathematics). On the author side, is it really too much to ask the
  author to tell you where you can find the proofs of the theorems?
