message: "Formalised and mechanised mathematics will change the nature of peer review. To check the most difficult proof for correctness you don't need to understand maths, just to know how to install and run Coq (or Agda etc). A failed formal mechanical proof can happen only through the gross violation of the proof assistant protocol, basically tantamount to cheating. \r\n\r\nThe role of the reviewer may be to value the originality and the significance of the result. Perhaps the originality can be also automated using tools like Turnitin. So all the reviewer can contribute is her highly dubious highly biased judgment regarding the 'significance' of the result or the beauty of the prose surrounding the maths. \r\n\r\nBut I am not sure we need this kind of judgement at all. We can simply publish on the Arxiv or on personal blogs (all code attached) and simply let the readers be the judges of what they read. \r\n\r\nAnd hiring and promotion committee will just need to invent different heuristics by which to judge how good someone is. Or perhaps they would need to read their actual papers and judge for themselves if they are any good rather than relying on proxies. \r\n\r\nFormalised and mechanised maths will render peer review obsolete."
