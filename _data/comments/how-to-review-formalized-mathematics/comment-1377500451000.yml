  Well, I understand that things are different at conferences, where computer
  scientists have to review too many papers in too short a time, and
  mathematicians seem to accept everybody and their mother because conferences
  are devoted more to "current work". But I am still troubled by what you
  (@Vilhelm) describe, namely a systematic deterioration of importance of
  proofs. If proofs are hidden in code and technical reports and people do not
  check them, in what sense is it still mathematics? There is no math without
  proofs. Proofs are sacred!


  Am I asking for too much, say for POPL? At least the authors shoudl enclose
  the code, and at least the reviewer should make sure it compiles, and have a
  glance at what the code is doing. With current behavior we deseve our own <a
