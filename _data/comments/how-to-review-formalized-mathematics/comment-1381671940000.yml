message: "Here is a related question on which you might like to give as your thoughts in a new blog post:\r\n\r\nIf a narrative paper is accompanied by a machine-verified formal proof, what is level of detail of the proofs is it appropriate to give in the narrative?\r\n\r\nI am arguably guilty of spelling out proofs in excessive detail in my own papers.  On the other hand, I have had too many experiences of blunders that resulted from not giving every detail of every proof.\r\n\r\nA possible answer to this is that a mathematical paper should be like a tourist guide: the audience want to get a general picture and can go into whatever level of detail they wish, but the guide must actually have been down all of the alleyways him/herself."
