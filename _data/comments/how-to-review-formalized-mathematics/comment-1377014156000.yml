message: "There is a good answer to the problem of preservation of the availability of the code: open archives sites. arxiv.org for example is dedicated to the long-term preservation of scientific articles, including software and mechanized proofs that are part of the work.  If you publish your article and accompanying code to arxiv, it will remain accessible in the future.\r\n\r\nNote that I am not sure this is a problem that arises at review-time. What is the issue with hosting one's code on an institutional webpage (that is bound to become dead in a few years) for the time of the review? I recently had to consider a similar question (for software rather than a mechanical proof), and decided to wait for potential acceptance of the article before submitting the short  version to arxiv (there is an accompanying research report that is already available with the code).\r\nI think questions such as \"will that piece of code remain available at the future?\" become more pertinent after the article is accepted for publication -- so after the work of the reviewer itself.\r\n\r\nI'm also not quite sure about the quality standards that must be applied to the proofs in the mechanized version. You are not really precise about that point in your requirements, but you say that they \"should be reviewed just as proofs on paper\", which might suggest similar clarity standards. In my experience this has been a target very difficult to meet; that could be distinguishing quality of an outstanding formalization work, but requiring that constantly could have the adverse effect of people reverting to pen&amp;paper proofs. Something that I found works better is to preserve an informal explanation of the mechanized proof, for example in an annex of the article, that has roughly the level of detail of a good \"proof sketch\" of a pen&amp;paper proof.\r\n\r\nThis last remark is also driven by pragmatics of the current publication process in communities that actively use mechanized proofs: conferences with short deadline, short page number limits, etc. This may change; I understand you've been careful to talk about reviewing and editing in an absolute sense, not necessarily tied to how today's actors do things. In that perspective, I'd agree your rules would be a target to attempt to reach -- but that requires process changes not only on the author's part. In any case I think the main point, that the mechanized sources be available along with the article, is essential and must already be required today."
