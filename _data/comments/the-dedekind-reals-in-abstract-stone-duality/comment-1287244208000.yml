message: "Dear Andrej,\nComes very close to my intuition of spacetime. This is considered to be a dual manifestatin of a finite metaphysical logical space defined by a simple mathematical object known sinc many decades. A perfect correlation between the internal logic, geomatrically visualized by this mathematical object, and the realization of Nature on the fundamental scale is found. The Everything is found to be the dual physical manifestation of an a priori existing logical space - like thought and its realization. A logical space does not have a fabric, is somehow a continuum that could get a logical structure when expressing some context.\n\nThat is why also spacetime, being its duality, should not have a fabric/ metric. In  connection with a new orbifold-substructured dynamic superstring concept it was found that these dynamic superstring entities holographically express themselves in the surrounding spacetime continuum.\nThis implies that spacetime gets a fabric / structure locally by the events that take place in it. The spacetime continuum does not a priori have a fabric, but gets it by events. The kind of fabric is geometrically defined according to what is expressed - the particle, gravity, fields ....\n\nThat is why I am so much interested. But my is pure intuition.\nI would be pleased to get a reply\n\n       Sincerely Paul \n\n paul_buecking@gmx.de"
