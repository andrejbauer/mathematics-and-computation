message: "I'm enjoying this series, but can't shake the feeling that what you are showing is not the difficulties for constructivist mathematics per se, but the difficulties of conceiving it as \"just\" classical mathematics minus the law of the excluded middle.\r\n\r\nLetâ€™s say we flip the assumption around and start with the decidable finite cases as the \"normal\" ones. Then it is the introduction of undecidability and infinity that blurs things and invalidates the law of the excluded middle, and requires more care to avoid paradoxes and fallacies.\r\n\r\nWith this approach, we end up with a mathematics where the constructive portions look a lot more like our naive intuitions and experience of numbers, and the â€œstonesâ€\x9D become those of classical mathematics.\r\n\r\nI realize this might seem heretical to pure mathematicians trained in the last century or so ;-), but it is essentially orthodox in theoretical computer science, for example."
