message: "Iâ€™m starting to doubt that sets are the proper abstraction to study. Wouldnâ€™t lists be more appropriate?\n\nIf you do insist on using sets, Iâ€™d at least like to know what the word means to you. Is it something I can define in Agda, or do I need to postulate (âŸ¨SetâŸ© : Set) as well as all the ZFC axioms?"
