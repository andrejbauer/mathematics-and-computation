  Rok: there is no circularity. Here `c` is a function which maps into the
  natural numbers `N`. For the natural numbers we can prove by induction that
  `forall n : NN, n = 1 or n != 1` (try it). So what you call "presupposition",
  namely that "either `c(S) = 1` or `c(S) != 1`" is something that we can
  actually prove separately.
