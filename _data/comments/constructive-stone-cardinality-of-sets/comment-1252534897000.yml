  Maybe the right spin here is that the classical concept of cardinality is
  really not all that important.  After all, it has rather poor properties when
  considered constructively, and I cannot think of very many things in math,
  other than those to do with cardinality itself, that rely on sets having
  definite sizes that are lined up linearly.  It's just a weird, possibly
  irrelevant, and, in the infinite case, rather poorly defined notion (relying
  as it does on arbitrary functions) anyway.
