message: "Reply to Jake (3): what do you mean by \"test whether `p = T`\"? It sounds like you expect equality to be somehow classical, i.e., two things are either definitely equal or definitely not-equal. In reality, the truth value `p = T` is `p`. Equality on the set of truth values `Omega` is the same thing as logical equivalence, i.e., `p = q` means `(p => q) and (q => p)`. It's not like we get to choose different equalities on our sets. Equality is a primitive notion, and it makes perfect sense constructively.\n\nReply to Samuel (4): lists are too limited because not every mathematical object is a list, or the image of a list. I am doing constructive mathematics informally in the style of Bishop. But if you press me, I will say that I am using higher-order intuitionistic logic, i.e., the internal language of a topos. This would be a bit like an impredicative Agda in which Prop is a type. And by the way, ZFC implies classical logic (because the axiom of choice implies the law of excluded middle). There is IZF, intuitionistic Zermelo-Fraenkel, but I don't need that. Topos if fine, and most of the arguments can be rephrased in type theory, if you read \"set\" as \"setoid\" and `Omega` as Prop."
