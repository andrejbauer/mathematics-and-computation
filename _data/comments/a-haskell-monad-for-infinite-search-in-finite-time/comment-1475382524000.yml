message: "S is also a Comonad. The extract function is simple: extract xs = find xs (const True). duplicate is a little bit more difficult: duplicate xs = S $ \\p -&gt; S $ \\q -&gt; find xs (\\a -&gt; p (S $ const a) &amp;&amp; q a)\n\nIntuitively, what duplicate does, given a predicate p, is produce another S. When that S is given a predicate q, it checks every value a in the original to see if it satisfies both p (singleton a) and q a.\n\nThis Comonad is not unique: It could also use False and (||) instead of True and (&amp;&amp;), or even False and xor."
