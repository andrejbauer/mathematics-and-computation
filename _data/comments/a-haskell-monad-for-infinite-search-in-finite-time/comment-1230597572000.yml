message: "This looks like an interesting idea. I have some questions. Have you checked that this is indeed a monad? Does \"sequence\" converge for an infinite lazy list? (When? Always?) In what sense is your invariant an invariant? What does the monad multiplication (=join) do? There is a candidate of a morphism from the search monad to your \"inversion\" monad, but not the other way round. And there is a morphism from the search monad to the continuation monad. But there aren't maps connecting the monads in the other directions (according to djinn).\r\n"
