  Sorry for commenting so late in the game, but I also noticed: aren't forevery
  and forsome just folds, with the arguments reversed? In particular, using the
  "S is a Monad" trait, then forevery and forsome are like disjunctive and
  conjunctive monoid versions of MonadPlus, except that MonadPlus isn't exactly
  a monoid (and thus, isn't a Monoid, either).
