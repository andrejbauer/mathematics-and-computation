  Emacs is in fact a highly exotic piece of software simply because it is a text
  editor. More importantly, consider the fact that Python, Java, C/C++, LaTeX,
  Ruby, etc. are never ever tied to a single text editor, whereas Agda is tied
  to Emacs. That is a huge hinderance to adoption of Agda. It has nothing to do
  with how good or bad Emacs is. Having to use a specific editor just to write
  code for Agda is a ridiculous requirement.
