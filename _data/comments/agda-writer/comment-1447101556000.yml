message: "Is Emacs really that bad?  Obviously it has a lot of features that the average user isn't going to make use of, but my impression was that recent versions of Emacs should be usable just like an ordinary word processor / text editor, now that the Emacs developers have fallen in line with the rest of the world on issues like the meaning of \"End\" and so on.  What is it about Emacs that takes 2 weeks to explain?\n\nIf someone came to me with a plan for something like this, my first inclination would be to suggest putting the effort into improving the Emacs Agda-mode instead.  Most of the extra features you mention should be implementable inside Emacs with a little work."
