  You mention looking for a cartesian closed category in which the coproduct 1 +
  1 does not exist. Examples of this are easy enough; e.g., let FinSet be the
  CCC of sets of natural number cardinality, and consider the full subcategory
  containing all such sets except those of cardinality 2. This is readily
  observed to be a sub-CCC [by the primality of 2]; however, it cannot contain a
  contain a coproduct 1 + 1. For, if a set of cardinality n were this coproduct,
  then the number of maps from n to, say, the three element set would have to be
  both 3^n and 3^2, but from this it would follow that n = 2.
