message: "Very nice paper!\r\n\r\nI think there may be a typo in the first paragraph of Sect. 2, by the way: you define that X is discrete if the diagonal map X --&gt; X^{\\nabla 2} is _constant_.  But if internally this is the condition that every map fron \\nabla 2 to X is constant, i.e. in the image of the diagonal map, should the original condition be that the diagonal map is _epimorphic_?"
