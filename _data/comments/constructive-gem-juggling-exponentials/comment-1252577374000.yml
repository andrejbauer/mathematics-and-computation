message: "Here's another way to represent the empty datatype:\n\ndata Zero = Zero (forall a. a)\n\nIn this way it is still not possible to construct values but at least you can use Zero's field as absurd pattern when pattern matching on it:\n\nzero_elim :: Zero -&gt; a\nzero_elim (Zero x) = x\n\nI like this one better, partly because you don't need to use undefined (or error)."
