  Pseudonym, I am pretty sure this is not the case, please provide a reference.
  For example, the <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%E2%80%93Bernstein%E2%80%93Schroeder_theorem"
  rel="nofollow">proof on Wikipedia</a> is not constructive because it tacitly
  assumes that `A = C \cup (A \\ C)`, see the proof for details. Beware,
  classical mathematicians sometimes use the phrase "constructive" when they
  mean "no use of the axiom of choice".
