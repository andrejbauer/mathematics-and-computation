  (One tiny comment just for the sake of not leaving errors unremarked upon: I
  did make one mistake above in post #21: I asserted that the situations where N
  is isomorphic to 2^(2^N) were another class of intuitionistic counterexamples
  to CSB. But in doing so, I invoked an injection from 2^N into 2^(2^N), which
  needn't exist intuitionistically; indeed, in the relevant cases, it generally
  won't)
