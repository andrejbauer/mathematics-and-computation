  Bob (2): Thanks for the idea. I suppose computer scientists really do
  understand "all propositions are decidable" better than "the law of excluded
  middle". On the other hand, this really is just terminology, since the law of
  excluded middle states <em>exactly</em> that all propositions are decidable:
  $\forall p \in \Omega, p \lor \lnot p$.
