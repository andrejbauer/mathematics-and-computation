  (Also, you could use the more sophisticated example from the more recent post
  on this very blog: in one of those non-trivial topoi where all functions are
  continuous [in a suitable sense], we have that $\mathbb{N}$ is isomorphic to
  $2^{2^\mathbb{N}}$, and thus the injections from $\mathbb{N}$ into
  $2^\mathbb{N}$ and back into $2^{2^\mathbb{N}} = \mathbb{N}$ present a
  counter-example to Cantor-Schroeder-Bernstein [$\mathbb{N}$ continuing, by
  Cantor's Theorem, to be non-isomorphic to $2^\mathbb{N}$].
