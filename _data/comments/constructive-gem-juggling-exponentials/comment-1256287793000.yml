  I took the liberty to edit your post and fixed the broken math. Yes, I agree
  that ultimately we can show that [0,1] and (0,1) are not homeomorphic,
  constructively, but for our purposes it is easier to just take your example
  (0,1) vs `(0,1) union (2,3)`. By the way, it is interesting to think about
  what "connected" means constructively, and which of the several notions of
  connectedness (0,1) satisfies.
