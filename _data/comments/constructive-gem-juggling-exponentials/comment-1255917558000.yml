  In response to Pseudonym, the Cantor-Schroeder-Bernstein theorem cannot be
  constructive in the relevant sense (e.g., provable in impredicative
  higher-order intuitionistic logic, the internal logic of topoi): it's possible
  to construct topoi in which all functions from reals (suitably constructed) to
  reals are continuous, but clearly the intervals (0, 1) and [0, 1] both admit
  injections into each other, while there can be no continuous bijection between
  them. [A similar argument could be made using a suitable subset of N and the
  intuitionistic consistency of the principle that all functions from N to N are
  computable].
