  Here's a little presentational suggestion.  It sounds rather technical and
  boring to phrase things as "whatever implies law of the excluded middle",
  because few of those you're trying to reach know or care what the "law of the
  excluded middle" is, or maybe even think it's trivially valid (because of the
  usual truth table interpretation).  It might be more informative to re-state
  this ever so slightly as "whatever implies that all propositions are
  decidable", which is more self-evidently meaningful, because it avoids jargon,
  and is more self-evidently absurd, because obviously not all propositions are
  decidable.  The point is that LEM involves both disjunction and negation,
  which have decidedly different meaning constructively than classically, so the
  formula itself is misleading.  Instead, express the semantics of it directly.
