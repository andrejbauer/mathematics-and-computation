message: "Of course, in a topos where all functions are continuous, the two (bijection and homeomorphism) amount to the same thing. Anyway, that (0, 1) and [0, 1] are non-homeomorphic should follow from the fact that every point in (0, 1) is a cut-point, while the two endpoints of [0, 1] are not. [In satisfying myself of the last line, I invoke near-trichotomy principles like `(p != q) => (p < q or p > q)` whose validity I suppose could vary from particular construction/notion of reals to particular construction of reals, but I'd be shocked if the argument couldn't be ultimately made to go through for any natural notion of reals or real-like quantities].\r\n\r\nAnyway, going back to what this was all originally being used for, the specific example of (0, 1) and [0, 1] isn't essential; I gave other, non-topological examples above of how to make the same ultimate point (about intuitionistic failure of Cantor-Schroeder-Bernstein), but even sticking to the topological approach, we can use (0, 1) and (0, 1) U (2, 3) instead, if it makes life easier. Clearly, each of these injects into the other, and clearly, they cannot be homeomorphic (the former is connected, the latter is not)."
