message: "The Ynot project is worth looking at: http://ynot.cs.harvard.edu. Although in theory whatever you could write in Ocaml you could write in Coq+Ynot, in practice it is probably not so easy. RZ has an advantage for the programmer who does not need to provide a formal proof of correctness.\n\nAs for the connection between effects and constructive reasoning, there is a point which I think is often overlooked by constructivists, that at least for some effects there is a corresponding Curry-Howard-isomorphic logic : classical logic. An example is the lambda-mu-calculus of Parigot. One problem with computational classical logic, however, is that it is not clear how to take it to dependent types."
