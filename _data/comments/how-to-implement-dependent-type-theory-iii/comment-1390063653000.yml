  Hi Mike, it sure does make sense to have lets for explicit substitutions. If
  you want to see a categorical model for a calculus of explicit substitutions
  (in the style of Abadi e at's lambda-sigma) check  Categorical Models of
  Explicit Substitutions (with Neil Ghani and Eike Ritter), Proc FOSSACS-99,
  LNCS 1578, Springer-Verlag, 1999, from
