  As far as I know, it doesn't matter if you use de Bruijn levels or de Bruijn
  indices. When you use indices, you have to shift the indices of unbound
  variables. When you use levels, you have to shift the levels of bound
  variables. So the two are completely dual. However, if you write an
  interpreter without full normalization (as in you don't normalize under
  abstractions), then you never see unbound variables. Therefore you never need
  to shift, which is why de Bruijn indices are preferable in that situation.
