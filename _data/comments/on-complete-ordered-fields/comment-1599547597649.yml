message: "@PaulTaylor: Paul, of course I remember [the paper](http://www.paultaylor.eu/ASD/dedras/dedras.pdf)! And I am sure you could tell I was relying on things that are in that paper. I think of this blog post as essentially stating that MacNeillec-completeness is unreasonably strong from a constructive point of view, and that we should replace it with Dedekind completeness.\r\n\r\nRegarding your idea: since the Dedekind reals are a Dedekind-complete archimedean field, if there's another Dedekind-complete field, it has to be non-archimedean, so I think your suggestion is going in the right direction. In the effective topos the Dedekind cuts will indeed be RE-like (thanks to countable choice)."
