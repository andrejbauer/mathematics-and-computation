message: "Hi Andrej. You and I wrote a paper about the Dedekind reals: http://www.paultaylor.eu/ASD/dedras See in particular Remark 12.13.\r\n\r\nThis suggests replacing general subsets with RE ones in the definition of Dedekind completeness and a Conway-like construction.  (Maybe these could then be the \"general\" subsets in a realisability topos.)"
