message: "As far as I can tell, Toby's argument requires cotransitivity of $<$, above I explicitly noted  this in the proof which gets you excluded middle from a complete order: the supremum $s$ of the set $S$ is either above $a$ or below $b$.\r\n\r\nThe idea to have $\\lnot\\lnot$-bounded Dedekind cuts is good! Let's see, in $Sh(X)$ for a reasonable $X$ the Dedekind cuts are the sheaf of real-valued continuous maps. The unbounded cuts correspond to maps into $[-\\infty,\\infty]$. The $\\lnot\\lnot$-bounded ones would be the maps into $[-\\infty, \\infty]$ which take on values $-\\infty$ and $\\infty$ on a set with empty interior? Indeed, those will fail to be locally bounded (which is what the archimedean axiom amounts to). \r\n\r\n But wait, such a sheaf does not form a ring in the topos. Hmmm."
