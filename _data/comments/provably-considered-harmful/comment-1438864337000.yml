message: "I usually refer to \"informal\" proofs as proofs which are written in words, and \"formal\" proofs as proofs which are written in a proofchecker (Coq, Minlog, Isabelle, etc.). But this only makes sense when this difference is in the scope of a paper.\r\nOn the other hand, there are many papers out there about data structures which are claimed to be \"optimal\" because of benchmarks or vague handwaving."
