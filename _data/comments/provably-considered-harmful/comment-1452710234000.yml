message: "I think in the context \"to apply logical methods ... to provide a sound foundation for obtaining ... provably correct algorithms\", the use of \"provably\" is correct, for two reasons. First, it falls under the \"unless you are a logician\" exception. What the sentence seems to be saying is \"we need solid logical foundations so that we can prove the correctness of algorithms\", and not just \"we need solid logical foundations so that we can develop correct algorithms\". I assume one of the purposes of the logical methods and solid foundations is to enable the activity of proving.\r\n\r\nThe second reason is that it is okay, in my opinion, to use the word \"provably\" in negative positions (i.e., on the left-hand side of an implication). An example of a negative occurrence is: \"The goal is to have a provably correct algorithm\". Or more explicitly: \"If we had a provably correct algorithm, then we'd have reached our goal\". There seems to me to be a clear difference between \"I want my algorithm to be correct\" and \"I want to be able to prove it\".\r\n\r\nIn positive statements, it is more iffy. I agree that it is mostly redundant to say in the title of your paper that it contains a \"provable theorem\". It would be equally silly to say that it contains a \"true theorem\". On the other hand, redundancy is not always a bad thing, depending on who might be the audience. In many parts of non-theoretical computer science, heuristic algorithms might be the norm, and testing might be an accepted means to establishing correctness, so someone might want to say that their algorithm is \"provably correct\" to emphasize that point and to set themselves apart from that community. \r\n\r\nAlso, if I say \"I cannot solve 3-SAT in polynomial time\", it's just a statement of personal inadequacy, but if I say \"I provably cannot solve 3-SAT in polynomial time\", it's a revolutionary claim."
