message: "I am all for clarity and against buzzwords. \nBut I am also against researchers who believe they own words. Your summary 'unless you are a logician, if you feel like using the word “provably”, just skip it', is exactly that. \n\"People, this is our word.. you don't get it, please let us grown-ups alone use it\".\n\nAssume you work in an empirical field, and all algorithms so far to solve problem X are just heuristics who happen sometimes to find the optimal solution. Now, researcher Y comes up with an algorithm that solves X always... how would you title it? \"Correct algorithm for X\"? Well, the others were 'correct' *for the people in the field* in the sense that it may have been good enough. Including provably indicates that you have a theoretical proof, which not all papers in CS have."
