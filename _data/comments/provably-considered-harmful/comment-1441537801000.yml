message: "I do not care much about what Jesus proved, but withint he domain of mathematics and mathematical papers, I would not really say that I am \"setting arbitrary limits\" when I ask that people use the word \"provable\" with its established meaning, which is \"has a proof\".\n\nIf anyone wants  to express \"lesser\" degrees of proof then they shlould qualify them, be it \"practically true\", \"true by experience\" or \"probabilistically provable\".\n\nYou expect that authors explain the word \"provable\" if they use it in a non-standard way. But my observation is that they do not, and they use it without thinking because it has become part of jargon in theoretical computer science. It is a buzzword which means nothing when used this way. And this is bad."
