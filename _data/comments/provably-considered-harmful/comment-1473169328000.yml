  Well, as I stated already, this is a rant. People who are close to logic
  should know better. People who work in algorithmics have a real need for a
  word that says "I actually proved that this thing does what it does". It's
  unfortunate that they picked "provably" because that makes it sound as "it's
  possible to prove that this thing does what it does", but I of course
  understand that they'll keep using it. If I had it my way, I would require all
  those heuristics to be qualified as "heuristically" or "experimentally" or
  some such, and then I would not need any words for the case with proofs. So,
  instead of "Optimal sorting aglorithm" and "Provably optimal sorting
  algorithm" we would have "Heuristically optimal sorting algorithm" and
  "Optimal sorting algorithm", respectively. After all, if the title of a paper
  makes a claim, say "Bananas are yellow" people expect the paper to demonstrate
  that bananas are yellow. In computer science, to demonstrate a property of an
  algorithm is to prove that property, because algorithms are mathematical
  objects. If the property is not actually proved, but rather experimentally
  verified, then the title should say so. But I realize that this is the point
  of view of a mad mathematician.
