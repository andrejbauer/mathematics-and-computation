  I think then perhaps you should say "formalized" proofs? In any case, using
  "formal" to actully mean formal is of course ok!


  Are you saying they let people publish claims of optimality based on
  handwaving? Then we should have a third category of "suspected optimal
  proofs". It is inexcusable that people who actually prove their claims need to
  emphasise that they did it. The others should be made to qualify their claims
  as "unproved".
