  Dear Thomas: good catch! I did not write that advertisment, but I will ask, as
  a member of PC, for the word provably to be removed. We'll see how it goes.


  I disagree with you about the use of words. Appropriating a standard phrase
  from one area of science and altering it slightly (or not so slightly) is
  impolite, and it creates confusion unecessarily. But what are all these other
  uses of "provably" that you have in mind?
