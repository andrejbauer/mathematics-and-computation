  @PeterSelinger: I am mostly ranting about the fact that it is an empty
  buzzword for a large chunk of computer science community. Of course there will
  be cases where it is appropriate to use "provably". I disagree a little bit
  with your examples because you say "provable" (implying it could be proved but
  maybe it was not) and "proved". For instance: "If we proved our algorithm to
  be correct then we'd reach our goal" seems better than "If there existed a
  proof of correctness of our algorithm then we'd reach our goal", and the
  latter is equivalent to "If we had a provably correct algorithm then we'd
  reach our goal".
