  I have a question regarding sequencing. In the definition $f_\mathrm{gen}(p) =
  f(p, \lambda x . \mathtt{return}(x))$ you assume that $f : P \times A^N \to A$
  is polymorphic in $A$, the carrier. How this can be? Usually an algebra
  includes interpretations of operations <strong>as well as a carrier</strong>.
  "Polymorphism" is mentioned only once, "lookup and update are polymorphic in
  the type T of the result", not this case.
