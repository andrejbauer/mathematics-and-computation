  @beroal (regarding generic effects and sequencing): let me be precise about
  $f_\mathrm{gen}$. Suppose $f$ is a <b>function symbol</b> of type $(P, N)$.
  (In particular, we are <b>not</b> assuming that there is a carrier $A$ or an
  operation $f : P \times A^N \to A$.) Then $f_\mathrm{gen}$ is a map $P \to
  F_\Sigma(N)$ defined by $$f_\mathrm{gen}(p) = f(p, \lambda x .
  \mathtt{return}(x)).$$ The thing on the right-hand side of this equation is
  <b>not</b> a function applied to arguments, but rather a tree seen as an
  element of the free algebra $F_\Sigma(N)$.
