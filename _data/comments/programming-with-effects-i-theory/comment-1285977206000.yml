message: "<q cite=\"Andrej Bauer\">Gordon Plotkin and Matija Pretnar had the important idea that a piece of code with unhandled fail amounts to an element of the free algebra for the signature fail:(1,0), while handled fail  corresponds to some other algebra for the same signature. The unique homomorphism from the free algebra to the other one is the handling construct.</q>\nAfter dwelling on the original paper I think there is more to say about that \"other algebra\", call it $R$. The carrier of $R$ ($U(R)$) is the set of final results. The operations of $R$ are handlers of computational effects, i.e. they define how a computational effect is converted to a final result. There is also a set $V$ of pure values and a function v that handles them, i.e. $v:V \\to U(R)$. It arises from the universal property of the free object $F(V)$ that $v$ uniquely extends to \"the unique homomorphism\" of type $F(V) \\to R$ which combines $v$ and $R$, i.e. handlers of pure values and computational effects, together. Correct?"
