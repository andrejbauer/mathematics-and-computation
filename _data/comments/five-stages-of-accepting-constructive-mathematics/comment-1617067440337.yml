  Thanks for this very interesting talk and paper. I'm very new in HoTT, and I
  saw the video of the talk in a Youtube playlist related to HoTT. Since I
  started my pure math education, I've been trained deeply in classical sense.
  My favorite mathematician was Cantor and  my favorite theorem was CSB theorem
  :) Before I meet with constructive math, I didn't even think that the
  possibility of omitting LEM, or that Cantor's paradise may not be so. I still
  appreciate all of works done by "classical" mathematicians, but I belive such
  a new kind of thoughts is worth to study on it. Today's math is almost lying
  on the works done in 1900s, and maybe, the future' math will be lying on the
  works done in 2000s. To rethink everything we took for granted is always a
  progressive idea. And thank you again for providing new perspective to me.
