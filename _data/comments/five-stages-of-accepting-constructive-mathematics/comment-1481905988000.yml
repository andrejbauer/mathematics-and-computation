  The paper is very readable and very interesting. But I didn't understand the
  example on p. 8, of the non-finiteness of subsets of {0, 1}. Are the subsets
  decidable in your constructive world? If so, what if I represent the subset
  input as a computation from {0,1} -&gt; {TRUE, FALSE} and test if 0 and/or 1
  are present in the subset? If the input programs -- even those denoting
  decidable sets -- are allowed not to terminate and yet the realizing program
  must always terminate, then how are any "for all" propositions realized? You
  write, “In computable mathematics a finite set is represented by a finite list
  of its elements, and a countable set by a program which enumerates its
  elements, possibly with repetitions.” Shouldn’t there be a third option:
  decidable countable subsets of a countable (or finite) set S, are realized by
  a program S -&gt; {TRUE, FALSE} ?
