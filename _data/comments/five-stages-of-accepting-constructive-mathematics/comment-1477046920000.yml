  Well, it is only contradictory if you assume that there is just one world of
  constructive mathematics, or if you presuppose that everything I say in the
  paper fits into a single world of mathematics. As I specifically speak about
  three differrent worlds in the Bargaining stage, I would hope it's not such a
  big problem if later on I do things which are not universally true everywhere.
  So I think it boils down to warning the reader that dependent choice is not
  valid in every world, and I decided this was not really necessary at that
  point.
