message: "Very interesting talk, and more relevant than ever a decade later as mathematicians keep applying the Platonist standard to our Aristotelian machines. I am still stuck on the anger part.\r\n\r\nFew questions, the number $a=1$ if Riemann hypothesis is true, and $a=0$ if it is not, is not a valid number for the lack of effective decision procedure. How then is A or B a set? I realize set theory is still used, but this seems inappropriate. Why not keep logic away from constructions (which sets are) all the way through?\r\n\r\nSimilarly, why is the notion of finite set defined in the same way as classically? These highly non-constructive meaningless notions is exactly why I was attracted to exploring constructive mathematics. Clearly the correct interpretation is that the set is FINITE (assuming for the moment we accept it even is a set rather than a logical predicate), but there is no bijection to a finite string of natural numbers.\r\n\r\nIt would be more convincing if constructive mathematicians went \"all in\" on constructive mathematics, rather than letting classical mathematics hold them back. The anger creeps in from the word games that need not be played."
