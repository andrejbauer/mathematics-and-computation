  You are mistaken about the form of AC needed in the proof of Theorem 1.3. The
  proof is constructive, of course! And it is <i>not</i> the case that we have
  "precisely one or two distinct inhabited subsets of $\{0,1\}$" because for
  that to be true you would need to know "$A = B$ or $A \neq B$", which would
  immediately decide $P$. The set $\{A, B\}$ is one of those funny sets which
  cannot be shown to be finite.


  And what is this idea that a set can be "defined" but not "constructively
  defined"? The language of set theory and first-order logic is <i>identical</i>
  in classical and constructive mathematics.
