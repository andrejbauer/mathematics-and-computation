  The subsets are not presumed to be decidable. And you can't just say things
  like "what if I represent the subset input as a computation from {0,1} ->
  {TRUE, FALSE} and test if 0 and/or 1 are present in the subset" without first
  properly setting up an interpretation of logic and set theory (or whatever
  formalism you have in mind) under which it is even possible to represent
  subsets as computations. You would probably need to use something like
  realizaiblity. However, note that <strong>general</strong> subsets cannot be
  represented by binary functions because not all subsets are decidable.
  Regarding your third option: that is just describing countable sets, possibly
  with decidable equality. And as soon as you say "realized" that means you're
  at stage three and you're thinking of a particular model. Whatever you
  discover a particular model may not be applicable to constructive mathematics
  in general.
