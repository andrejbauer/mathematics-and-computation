  dear andrej, congratulations to all of you on this book. i think it's
  wonderful that you have collaborated in this way, and am also very positive
  about the open source approach in the publishing. let's hope that this type of
  collaboration spreads, replacing the `idiosyncrasies' that you mention. best
  wishes, frank
