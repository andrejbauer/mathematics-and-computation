message: "Dear Andrej. \n\nThank you very much for sharing this marvelous experience. Being in other (non-math) fields, I'm particularly interested in the process and tools used to develop the book. \n\nHow did you -with and/or others- convinced or helped authors to use git(hub)? What help did you had to offer, on what areas, and what tools where used for such a distributed version control system? \n\nThe same applies to the editor: what ones were used? What kind of support you had to give the authors? \n\nI'm sure those learnings can be of great value for many other similar teams. \n\nIn any case, thank you all very much. This is a great and inspiring example of what can we collectively achieve if we collaborate a little more. :)\n\nBest...\n\n--\ne"
