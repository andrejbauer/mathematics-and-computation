message: "Just wanted to say: all of those who worked on this deserve medals or whatever your favourite form of showing-appreciation-from-the-general-public is, because not only this is really exciting material, but it was all performed openly (git!) and published for free! I hope this will set an example for future researchers as how-things-should-be-done. I'm so happy about this I will probably order a hardcover, haha.\n\nCongratulations and thank you!"
