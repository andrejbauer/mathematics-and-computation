message: "Really appreciate the way you all went. \n\nThere is a circle of more or less active Linux kernel developers in Germany, meeting every year or two in a relaxed manner. The basic statement of the last meetings, althoug some of us still are contributing strongly, was that Linux kernel development is not the key any more. The motivation to develop something new, to establish a non commercial alternative concept to Microsoft, Apple and whoever UNIX supplier is not longer the catching point.\n\nThe Linux concept is mainstream and the Open Source idea is now adopted and driven even by the commercial key players in this segment. \n\nOne common sense raised in the these days more socialy focused meetings in the last two years - that after software development understood the \"good\" in being open, now content - any content - raises the public issues. Monopolies on information and data - like the peer review process organized by the publishers in science, like the MP3 avoidance strategy of many labels, like the decreasing number of companies that own rights on electronic maps - are the boiling point of our discussions these days and alternatives like open street map, creative commoms licenses for music and I really appreciate the excample you provide by publishing and researching in a kind of \"swarm inteligence\"."
