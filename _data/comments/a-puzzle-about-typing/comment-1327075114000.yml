  I think I have an answer to the first part of the puzzle: two simple types
  with disjoint type variables will always unify: thinking of types as binary
  trees, just superimpose the two trees and read off the substitutions from the
  places where one tree terminates earlier than the other.  When typing a term,
  we must do a unification for each application; if term variables are only used
  once then the left- and right-hand terms of any application can be given types
  with disjoint type variables.
