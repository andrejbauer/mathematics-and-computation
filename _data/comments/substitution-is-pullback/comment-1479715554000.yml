  Use the fact that a predicate $P$ on a set $A$ can be viewed as a subset
  inclusion $P \subseteq A$. That is, you should switch between "$P$ is a
  predicate on $A$", "$P$ is a subset of $A$" and "subset inclusion $i_P : P \to
  A$", as the occasion requires.


  For instance, if someone says "substutution of a term into a predicate is
  pullback", then we clearly need a pullback square, so four arrows. The two
  arrows we start with are $t : B \to A$ (the substituted term) and the subset
  inclusion $i_P : P \to A$ (and you can figure this out because of the three
  forms of understanding "$P$ is a predicate on $A$" only this one is an arrow).
  The other two arrows are a subset inclusion $i_Q : Q \to B$ where $Q = \lbrace
  y \in B \mid t(y) \in P\rbrace$ and the arrow $Q \to P$ which is the
  restriction of $t$ to $Q$, i.e., it takes $y \in Q$ to $t(y) \in P$. Does that
  help?
