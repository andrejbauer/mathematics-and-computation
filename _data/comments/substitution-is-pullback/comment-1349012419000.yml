message: "This result is <b>folklore</b>, which is a technical term for a method of publication in category theory.  It means that someone sketched it on the back of an envelope, mimeographed it (whatever that means) and showed it to three people in a seminar in Chicago in 1973, except that the only evidence that we have of these events is a comment that was overheard in another seminar at Columbia in 1976. Nevertheless, if some younger person is so presumptuous as to write out a proper proof and attempt to publish it, they will get shot down in flames.\n\nUndoubtedly people have known this as a fact for a very long time.\n\nHowever, I couldn't find any published papers from the 1970s that formulated this result. It seems unlikely that it was done then because the categorists of that day had come from traditional pure mathematics and were not familiar with formal syntax.\n\nI would like to know who did write this down in any formal way first.\n\nWithout asserting my own priority, let me cite my book <i>Practical Foundations</i>, in particular Section 4.3 and Chapter VIII, as a place where it is done.\n\nI describe a construction there of the classifying category or category of contexts and substitution that works for any type theory with all of the structural rules (ie not linear logic) and possibly dependent types.  This derives a sketch (essentially, generators and relations for the category) more or less directly from the syntax.  Then the category is obtained easily from the sketch.  This separates the \"chalk\" of recursive definitions of syntax from the \"cheese\" of associative composition in a category.\n\nNote to the old-timers: substitution is not given by <b>forming</b> the pullback. We construct the denotations of the original and substituted term or predicate first and then observe that they obey the universal property of a pullback.  Not all pullbacks need exist in the syntactic category.\n\nNow I have a confession to make.  I cannot see the obvious reason why the interpretation of the language in another category with the appropriate structure defines a <b>functor</b> from the classifying category.  Certainly there is a function on objects and morphisms and the universal properties of products and exponentials correspond to the type theoretic rules. What I cannot see is why the function preserves composition."
