  On the pullback diagram, are the objets sets?, predicates? sets formed by
  predicates?

  When you say: "Q is the pullback of the inclusion P \hookrightarrow B along
  t", do you say it in the same why as  "p2 is a pullback or fiber product of
  the pair. We also say that p2 is the pullback of f along g" from
  [http://www.math.mcgill.ca/triples/Barr-Wells-ctcs.pdf page 273]; if yes, then
  I must conclude that Q is an arrow, t(x) is an arrow, the inclusion from P to
  B is an arrow and the objects are the sets A, P &amp; B; but then I'm missing
  the arrow from A to P and from A to B.

  I'm a noob and I'm going nuts trying to figure it out
