message: "Intuitively, composition is also a pullback.  $f;g$ is the \"pullback\" of a morphism $g : B \\to C$ along $f : A \\to B$ to obtain a morphism of type $A \\to C$.\n\nOne way of formalizing the intuition is to work in subsumptive reflexive graph categories (Dunphy &amp; Reddy, Parametric Limits, LICS 2004), where we have \"logical relations\" in addition to morphisms.  Perhaps there are other ways as well."
