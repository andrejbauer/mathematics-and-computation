message: "OpenTheory is an example of what I mean by a proof object, and there is a large codebase, apparently produced by Nobody Ever. (I once wrote a rudimentary checker for it, in order to understand what it is about.) There is no way to make shortcuts. (Common HOL seems to be similar in this respect, as far as I see. I am surprised by what you say about Dedukti. I thought it is purely a proof CHECKER and produces no output at all. So how would it make shortcuts?)\r\n\r\nI want a proof object not only in memory, I want it on file! What's the big deal about delivering it, instead of only making promises (\"trust me that  the object COULD be had in explicit form.\") But I am happy that you agree that it is a good thing to provide SOME sort of access to the proof objects as they are implicitly built, which otherwise would only have an ephemeral existence. Maybe theorem prover software could provide some hooks where users can insert their callback routines, for performing inductive constructions or whatever they like? Is that what you mean?"
