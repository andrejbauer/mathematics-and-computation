  People have devised formats for "stored" proofs (compiled .vo files and
  compiled Agda files etc.) but nobody ever uses them to communicate proofs.
  They are used as an optimization technique for faster loading. Everybody
  communicates <em>the original scripts</em> which also search for proofs.
  Everyone, except in the case that there was an extraordinary amount of search
  involved, in which case people take additional care to store the results of
  the search. Flyspeck has a huge proof, so there they also optimized somewhat.
  But in the vast majority of cases people just communicate the original
  scripts, with proof search an all.


  I am advocating that <em>we look at what is actually going on</em>. I think it
  is too easy to be blided by philosophy and logic. It is too easy to assume
  that the proof scripts which search for a proof are inefficient. They are not
  for a simple reason: their authors could not work with inefficient proof
  scripts because they had to rerun them many times, and modify them slightly,
  etc., before they took a final form. So by design they must be modular,
  efficient, and manageable. In contrast, the compiled versions of the same
  scripts are unmodifiable, impossible to inspect by humans, and yes, they are
  more efficient, but that does not matter so much.


  So, as far as I am concerned, the original proof scripts written by humans are
  as good a certificate as the "stored" communication. At least practice shows
  that is the norm.
