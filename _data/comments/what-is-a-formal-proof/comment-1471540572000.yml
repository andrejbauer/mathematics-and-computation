message: "\"Computing the result of a ?-reduction is precisely as complicated as verifying that someone else gave you the correct ?-reduction.\" Indeed, namely both are straightforward, at least if you have a computer. This is still on the diametrically opposite side of the spectrum from the undecidable or semidecidable concepts of formal proof that have been discussed. I am fine with a formal proof format that would contain steps of the form \"Now perform  ?-reduction for the term starting at position 12 in expression 34 and call the result expression 567\". Essentially a trace of the commands that are passed to the nucleus/kernel, a record of the elementary steps that lead from the assumptions to the theorem. Why shouldn't Coq or Isabelle output such a proof, and call it THE FORMAL PROOF, for everybody to see and scrutinize? Of course, programming capacity, other features more urgent, etc., but in the long run? \n\nI see that the flyspeck project of the Kepler conjecture has apparently produced such run-down version of the proof that can be fed to the core, see http://www.proof-technologies.com/flyspeck/\nIt looks something like 100 MBytes compressed, but it is reported that it runs a lot faster than the original proof scripts. These people were really concerned about confidence! But nothing like \"too big to be communicated”.\nOn that website I just learned that what I am advocating has a name:  \"De Bruijn criterion\"."
