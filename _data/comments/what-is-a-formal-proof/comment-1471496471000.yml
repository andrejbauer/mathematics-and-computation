  For what it's worth, let me emphasize my own (current) perspective that the
  purpose of producing derivation trees is not to increase confidence, but to
  <i>have</i> derivation trees, which you then might want to do something else
  with.  I'm more or less content with Andrej's proposal to beta-reduce away the
  derivation trees in the middle and instead do the "something else" directly as
  we are checking the proof that would have produced the derivation tree, but
  the point is that there's more going on than "increasing confidence".
