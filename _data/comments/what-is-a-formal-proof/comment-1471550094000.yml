  Okay, now I'm confused again.  Matt, presumably the process that you're
  calling "proof checking" is not decidable, otherwise you wouldn't be making a
  big deal out of how we don't need decidability.  But I don't see a qualitative
  difference between "non-decidable checking" and "searching".  Is your "proof
  checking" really just a kind of "proof search" whose input contains hints to
  make it faster?
