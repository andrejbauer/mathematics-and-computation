message: "Here is a passage from Section 4 of the above-mentioned paper about Coqine:\n\"Indeed, although the translation is linear, some of them are too big.  For instance, the Coq.Lists.List module, whose .vo file has length 260KB, is translated into a Dedukti file of length 1.2MB, which is in turn translated into a Haskell file of size 12MB.\"\nNote in particular that \"the translation is linear\". This supports my assumption.\n\nMaybe someone can figure out the length of the Coq.Lists.List source script. (I only find Coq.Lists.List.html, which contains lots of links and colors). Andrej what do you mean with storing the conclusion? Only the statements of the theorems (plus definitions etc.) without proofs? Does it make sense that storing the conclusions of Coq.Lists.List would take 260kB?\n\nFurthermore, how should we trust a system that reads in conclusions and proceeds from there without checking them?"
