message: "&gt; But I have the impression that by noting that decidability is not enough, people on this discussion jump to the conclusion that any precisely defined efficiency criterion must be avoided.\n\nNo, I just pointed out that:\n1) Efficiency criteria from complexity theory don't work.\n2) By the nature of the situation, there is no need for efficiency criteria.\n\nYou can have criteria, I just think it's for nothing.\n\n&gt; When I said that stringent run-time bounds should be imposed, I meant actually that reconstructing a proof from the script should not be an algorithmic issue at all (besides “trivial” book-keeping tasks perhaps).\n\nSo it seems that you don't have any precisely defined efficiency criterion. You have to just know a good proof object format when you see it. And apparently proof scripts ain't one of 'em.\n\nI think I might be able to predict your judgment though. I've replied to your question about good systems for independent checking. The reply currently awaits moderation."
