  You don't appreciate confidence? Then what's the point of developing formally
  verified mathematics and formally verified computer programs? I thought it is
  about how we know that a theorem (or the result of a program) is correct. Or
  is it just an exercise in software development? (And is the flyspeck project
  detached from reality?)
