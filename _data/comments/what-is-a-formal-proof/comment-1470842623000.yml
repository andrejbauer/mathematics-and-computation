message: "Technically, denial-of-service attacks are very easy to protect against in this situation. Just give the PCC consumer a \"cancel\" button to interrupt the checker and reject the PCC.\r\n\r\nOf course, the thoughtful PCC provider will provide proofs that check quickly. It's really not much different from loading a web page. They should load fast. If they don't, it's the provider's problem because the consumers will cancel. If it weren't for security vulnerabilities (which a PCC client shouldn't have) there would be no danger in attempting to load an arbitrary page.\r\n\r\nSo I figure proof checking should be properly sandboxed, but checking performance is not a security concern."
