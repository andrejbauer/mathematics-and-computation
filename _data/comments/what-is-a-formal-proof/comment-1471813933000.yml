message: "This is an important and subtle point that I was stuck on for a while too.  I agree entirely that in order for a \"proof\" to count as a \"proof\", we have to be able to check that it is a proof without needing any of the intuitive leaps that might have gone into <i>finding</i> the proof.  Otherwise, there is no qualitative difference between Pierre de Fermat and Andrew Wiles.\r\n\r\nBut this doesn't require that there is a particular notion of \"putative proof\" that can be decidably checked.  What it requires is that <i>particular</i> proofs can be <i>algorithmically</i> (and, one hopes, feasibly) checked.  Having an algorithm that I can feed Wiles' proof of FLT to (or any particular proof that someone has written) and have it tell me \"yes this is a proof\" is quite a different thing from asking that the algorithm can be fed <i>any</i> string of gibberish and have it answer either \"yes this is a proof\" or \"no this is not a proof\".  In other words, the requirement that \"proofs be proofs\" is only about the <i>correct</i> proofs, whereas giving up decidability is only about what happens with the <i>incorrect</i> proofs."
