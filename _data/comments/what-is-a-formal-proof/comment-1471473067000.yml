  A small point first: it's Andrej (Slovenians are obsessed with J's: all my
  parents, grand-parents and children's names start with J.)


  The LCF-style evaluator (which only implicitly construct the proofs) are
  <em>simpler</em> than kernels of proof assistants that rely on checking proof
  objects. For instance, computing the result of a $\beta$-reduction is
  precisely as complicated as verifying that someone else gave you the correct
  $\beta$-reduction. There is no complicated system behind an LCF-style proof
  assistant. The complicated systems exist it proof assistants like Coq and
  Lean, and for those it makes sense to have an independent proof checker (which
  is then still more complicated than the core of HOL or Andromeda). So I do not
  actually believe that there is anything to be gained by producing complete
  derivation trees. It does not increase confidence in anythign. What
  <em>does</em> increase confidence is an independent implementation of the
  nucleus.
