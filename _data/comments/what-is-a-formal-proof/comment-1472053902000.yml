message: "About Flyspeck:\r\nEfficiency was only one of the reasons why the flyspeck team exported the proof to an external format, and anyway, a running time of 3 hours is not such a big issue; as far as I understand, this export was only done at the end as part of an \"audit\". The other reasons were (b) independent verification and (c) interoperability, making the intermediate results available to other users, see http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.02155, the end of section 4. \r\n\r\nAnswering another question: I don't know if if it is customary for people to download exported files in HOL0 and OpenTheory. Last summer I went to a session on proof exchange formats when CADE was in Berlin, and there is a community. OpenTheory has a mailing list, and it generates traffic from time to time.\r\n\r\nI think that independent verifiability is important, but the more pressing problem is interoperability. Do we have to formalize the whole body of basic mathematics five or ten times? Now that we have proved the Kepler conjecture in HOL-Light, why isn't it true in Coq? (Such would be question of a naive plain mathematician.) But once it is exported, the Coq people could grab it and see what they can do about it, and Mike can do \"something else\" with it, transforming it beyond recognition."
