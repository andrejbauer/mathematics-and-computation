  I realize that what I said about "stringent runtime bounds" and even
  "linear-time proof checking" is nonsense. It was a poorly thought-out metaphor
  for having a proof object that consists of a list of deduction steps,
  following a simple specification of deduction rules. For example: when forming
  a term that applies a function to an argument, or when performing a
  substitution, this is a single command in OpenTheory, but of course it
  requires some type checking or processing that may be linear in the size of
  the involved expressions if implemented naively. I believe one can construct
  OpenTheory files that would take even exponential time to check, in terms of
  their length (but never longer than the kernel took to run originally when the
  proof was produced).
