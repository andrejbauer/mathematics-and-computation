  The process of formally verified proof, of course, is about increasing
  confidence relative to pencil-and-paper proof (among other things).  Andrej is
  saying (if I understand him correctly) that producing and checking proof
  <i>objects</i> does not increase confidence appreciably <i>more</i> than
  checking proof <i>steps</i> does.
