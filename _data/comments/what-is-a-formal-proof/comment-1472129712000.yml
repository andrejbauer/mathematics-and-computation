  I am convinced that we have to formalise basic mathemaics five or ten times,
  and moreover this is not a bad idea, nor is it waste of time. We are at a very
  early stage of computer-assisted mathematics and we still have a lot to
  discover. People should be and are experimenting. By redoing other people's
  work they learn and they improve state-of-the-art (or not). One part of such
  experimentation is redoing things others have done. Another is looking for
  interoperability, of course.


  But there will never be just one way of doing mathematics (that would be a
  disaster), nor will there be a sort of universal interoperability that some
  mathematicians imagine. For that to happen humanity would have to be an ant
  hill, or Borg.
