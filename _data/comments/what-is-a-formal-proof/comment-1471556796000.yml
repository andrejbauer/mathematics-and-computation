message: "Replying to Matt (and trying to make sense).\r\nBetween \"recording everything\" and replaying it dumbly (derivation checking) on the one hand, and saving only the user inputs and searching for the proof from scratch on the other hand, there is apparently a spectrum of choices, offering a trade-off between storage space and processing time. What you suggest, (\"check-time\" tactics), with more hints to avoid expensive proof searching, is an intermediate choice. Apparently the Coq .vo file with a series of \"instructions\" is another intermediate choice. Finding the right balance in terms of running time and storage is an engineering decision.\r\n\r\nComing back to the original question, \"What is a formal proof?\": Such practical consideration are irrelevant for this question. The proof IS the full derivation, in my view. Coming up with a smart succinct representation from which the proof can be reconstructed does not change the concept of a proof.\r\nA \"proof script\" is not a formal proof. It is perhaps analogous to a proof sketch in a classical hand-written proof, as opposed to the complete proof with all details, which is given in the full version of the paper.\r\n\r\nCompressed video has completely different side constraints. A lot of engineering effort (and running time) goes into video compression in order to make decompression easy. It is not (yet) the case that large stored proofs would routinely be replayed by thousands of eager proof aficionados. (This is not quite true: proof libraries ARE loaded by many users.) I guess the gzip compression that is used in the flyspeck project is probably quite appropriate at this stage of development, as opposed to some cleverer problem-specific shortcuts in the file format."
