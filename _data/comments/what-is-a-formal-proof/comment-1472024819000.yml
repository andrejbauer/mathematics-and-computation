message: "Matt, I agree very much with your arguments that decidability per se is useless in this context. Thanks for supporting my point so eloquently.\r\nBut I have the impression that by noting that decidability is not enough, people on this discussion jump to the conclusion that any precisely defined efficiency criterion must be avoided.\r\n\r\nWhen I said that stringent run-time bounds should be imposed, I meant actually that reconstructing a proof from the script should not be an algorithmic issue at all (besides \"trivial\" book-keeping tasks perhaps).\r\nOf course, I did not mean that \"stringent run-time bounds\" should be the only criterion and common sense should be abandoned. Artificially padding the proof format would not work because it would just make the proofs longer with no gain in overall running time."
