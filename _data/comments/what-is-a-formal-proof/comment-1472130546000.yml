  This discussion is similar to the one I had with Mike. Yes, proof scripts are
  not proof objects, but they are a good way of creating, managing, and
  communicating proof objects. The proof objects need not exist in computer
  memory because nobody needs them in that form. Nobody ever produces them in
  that form (not Dedukti, not Coq, not Agda, not Lean â€“ they all make shortcuts
  and omit large chunks of proof objects). What we need to know is that the
  proof objects are there, somewhere. and that we can trust our proof assistant
  that the object <em>could</em> be had in explicit form.


  Mike Shulman proposed a good criterion. Rather than prescribing a particular
  representation ("I must have a proof object in memory!") he wants the
  universal property of proof objects, namely, he wants to be able to perfrom
  inductive constructions on them. There are many ways of providing such
  functionalty, only one of which is to "give proof objects".
