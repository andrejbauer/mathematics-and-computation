message: "Again we are mixing different concepts, inspection by humans, cooperation between parties, you want to modify or extend a proof. Proof scripts have their role, there is not doubt about that.\n\nIndependently, I am arguing that proof scripts are not \"Proof objects\". Proof objects also have their role, and \"Proofs assistants must provide proofs that can be independently checked.\" It is those proof objects about which I am talking.\n(Has the QED manifesto been abandoned?) And of course it does not make sense if this checking falls back on the search strategies by which the proof was constructed. Don't take my running time prescriptions literally. I meant that the specification of the proof format is so simple that checking it is not a big issue; (the \"interpreted specialized language\" comparison is good, but there should not be a simple command that triggers a complicated computation. And no compiled universal language.)\n\n\"we look at what is actually going on\": I though this blog post was about criteria that formal proofs *should* satisfy, rather than *describing* the state of affairs? ;-) Anyway, this seems to be the main argument against requiring proof objects that are independently checked, that it does not conform to common practice. But people rarely have a choice these days. OpenHOL export for HOL-Light is proprietory. OpenTheory support seems to be a little better. (I don't know much about Agda, and the .vo format; some issues with .vo have been mentioned in other comments.)\nIf I would like to use a proof system whose proofs I can independently check, which systems would you recommend? So much for mocking the angry mob about how their professed beliefs match up with their practice. (Not that I would count myself among the proof assistant mob and be offended.)\n\nTwo more items about \"what is actually going on\":\na) Isabelle has the option to call external proof strategies over the internet. (Some of these are even proprietory.) When the proof succeeds, Isabelle tries to see which assumptions are used and reconstruct the proof internally with fewer assumptions, which sometimes helps. Sometimes it fails. Wouldn't it be nice if Isabelle could examine the \"proof object\" and import it?\nb) I hear that in those competitions that are held in connection with the ATP conferences, it is required that the participating algorithms provide some evidence of the proof. (Not that there would be a standard format for that). This is the reason why Isabelle never gets the prize, although it usually performs quite well."
