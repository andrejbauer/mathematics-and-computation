message: "Maybe I can try to explain again what I mean by a proof object.\r\nEvery proof system has an underlying logic with a handful of deduction rules.\r\nA *formal derivation* of a theorem is a sequence of commands that might typically look as follows: \"Apply rule 1 to theorem 23 and theorem 45 and call the result theorem 67\"\r\nA *proof object* is an explicit representation of a formal derivation. By explicit I mean that it is no big deal to reconstruct the derivation from it. For example, the \"addresses\" like 45 might be represented by references in memory. But it is not permitted to search for missing derivation steps. (The OpenTheory file format, as an example, isn't very difficult: http://www.gilith.com/research/opentheory/article.html)\r\n\r\nI have given some indications from the literature by the Coq team why I think that .vo files must contain proof objects. Please share your reasons for believing that they don't."
