  In an adverserial situation you have to worry about denial-of-service attacks,
  so it is likely you'll restrict the form of the proofs that you accept, i.e.,
  they wouldn't be arbitrary programs but rather something more restrictive, for
  instance you could require an explicitly given low time complexity.
  Consequently, the other party will have to do more work to find suitable
  proofs (and that's not something you want to do to a <em>partner</em>).
