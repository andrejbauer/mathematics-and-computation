  I am not sure I understand you. Are you saying that you expect $\prod_A B
  \equiv \prod_C D$ to imply $A \equiv C$ and $B \equiv D$? To be honest, I just
  started typing it up in Coq and then Coq wanted me to invent a more general
  induction hypothesis, and I did. The usual stuff. Let me put some comments
  into the relevant file and come back to you.
