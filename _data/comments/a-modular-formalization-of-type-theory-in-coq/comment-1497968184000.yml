  Hi Andrej,


  You have indeed understood what I meant.


  If you try to prove that typing is unique up to judgmental equality for the
  usual syntax, you run into a problem in the application case. Induction tells
  you that  ?AB??CD, but you can't conclude that  A?C and  B?D from that, which
  is what you need to get the proof to go through.


  Adding annotations to applications and lambdas should fix this problem (and
  since you did it in Coq, it obviously does fix it). I didn't read your Coq
  development closely enough to realize that this is what you were doing, but
  your explanation makes things make sense to me now.
