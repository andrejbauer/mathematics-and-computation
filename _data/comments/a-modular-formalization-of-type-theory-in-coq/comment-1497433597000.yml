  Oh, perhaps it's worth mentioning that the syntax is fully annotated. In
  particular, abstractions are written as $\lambda A . B . e$ and applications
  as $e_1 @^{A.B} e_2$, indicating both the domain and the codomain. Is that
  what worries you?


  We're currently in the process of modifying syntax so that it becomes
  configurable. Then it should be clearer what assumptions precisely are needed
  for uniqueness.
