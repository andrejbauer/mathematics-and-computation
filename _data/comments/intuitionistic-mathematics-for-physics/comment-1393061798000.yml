message: "For years I have looked to find a community of mathematicians who are not comfortable with analysis as it is traditionally taught. When I was young in college I started to explore intuitionism, but my life took a different path, yet I always retained an interest in mathematics as a 'talented amateur'! \n\nI often wondered if it wasn't possible to construct a mathematics in which dx was a new number outside of the systems constructed for the real numbers, such that dx^2 vanished but dx had no multiplicative inverse.\n\nMuch appreciate your links."
