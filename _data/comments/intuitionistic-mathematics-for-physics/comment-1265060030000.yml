message: "Dear Andrej,\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt reply and encouragement!\r\n\r\nThough the Amazon.com <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QFX4MVXNS87D/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm\" rel=\"nofollow\">reviews</a> of Calculus Demystified weren't very positive, by and large, the Schaum's outline series looks good. The <a href=\"http://www.stanleyschmidt.com/FredGauss/index2.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Life of Fred</a> series, which was recommended to me in the past, also looks like it might be a winner.\r\n\r\nIt's good to hear both that it's likely possible to avoid a study of classical mathematics in order to be able to get to intuitionist mathematics, and also that my concern about potential difficulties unlearning the classical stuff wasn't unfounded.\r\n\r\nAgain, thanks!"
