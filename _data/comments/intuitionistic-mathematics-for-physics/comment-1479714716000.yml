  It is traditional (and in my opinion misleading) to refer to the object of all
  truth values as "the object of propositions". I do not know why that is. In
  Coq the object is called <code>Prop</code>, for instance. In a topos it is
  $\Omega$, and it is isomorphic to $\mathcal{P}(\lbrace * \rbrace)$.


  You are mistaken about excluded middle. It is not expressed as $\forall S \in
  \mathcal{P}(\lbrace * \rbrace) . S \lor \lnot S$ but rather as
  \mathcal{P}(\lbrace * \rbrace) . \star in S \lor \lnot (\star in S)$. In any
  case, this is a technicality which can be dealt with in many ways. For
  instance, one can observe that $\mathcal{P}(\lbrace * \rbrace)$ is a complete
  Heyting algebra under the $\subseteq$ ordering, and that logical formulas
  denote elements of this Heyting algebra. Then, once can really write $S \lor
  \lnot S$, and this would mean the same thing as $S \cup (\lbrace{\star\rbrace
  \setminus S)$. I recommend that you consult a textbook such as Scott &amp;
  Lambek's "Introduction to Higher-Order Categorical Logic". They explain these
  things there. You will also learn from that textbook about internal languages,
  which allow us to mix syntactic forms with semantic objects.
