message: "Anonymous: You're right about the derivative of $x^n$ and wrong about the derivative of $e^x$. Before you write down an infinite sum, like you did, you have to argue that they make sense. Which they don't in synthetic differential geometry. There are no axioms that ensure completeness of the smooth real line with respect to Cauchy sequences. Nor can there be such axioms, because they would allow us to define a non-smooth function as an infinite sum.\r\n\r\n Actually, the exponential function is introduced as the solution of the differential equation $y' = y$ with the initial condition $y(0) = 1$, so the derivative of $e^x$ is postulated to be $e^x$."
