message: "Answer to mark's question about absolute value: suppose we had an operation which assigned to every number `x` a number `|x|` such that `x &lt; 0 => |x| = -x` and `x &gt; 0 => |x| = x`, where `a &lt;= b` is defined as `not (b &lt; a)`. Above we proved that for infinitesimal `dx` we have `0 &lt;= dx &lt;= 0`, therefore both `|dx| = dx` and  `|dx| = -dx` from which it follows that `dx = 0`. So, if absolute value exists then all infinitesimals are zero. But this contradicts the principle of micro-affinity, because if all infinitesimals are zero, then for all infinitesimal `dx`\n<blockquote>\n `0 * dx = 0 = 1 * dx`\n</blockquote>\nand now by the law of cancellation we get `0 = 1`.\n\nBut this is nothing to despair about, because the absolute value exists as a function `{x in R &nbsp;|&nbsp; x &lt;= 0 or 0 &lt;= x} -> R`, defined by\n<blockquote>\n`|x| = x` &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if `x &gt;= 0`<br />\n`|x| = -x` &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if `x &lt;= 0`\n</blockquote>\nIt's just that you need to know the sign of `x` in order to compute its absolute value."
