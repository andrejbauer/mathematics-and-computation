message: "Hey Andres,\r\n\r\nI saw a pop-science article on Nicolas Gisin, a Swiss physicist who is ... I'm not sure.  Let's just say he is mentioning intuitionistic math and physics in the same sentence.\r\n\r\nThere's a paper of his on Arxiv.  https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.01653\r\n\r\nMy take is that his understanding of intuitionistic math is screwy.  But, if he and other physicists wants a mathematics where a finite amount of physical space can only hold a finite amount of information, he's on the right track."
