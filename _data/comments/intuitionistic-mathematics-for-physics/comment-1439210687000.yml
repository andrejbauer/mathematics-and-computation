message: "I agree, it's only an entry point. It's useful for students, I would say, to have a concrete example of existence. Also, automatic differentiation schemes are based on little more than this, and have become very important in neural networks.\r\n\r\nSIA is amazing, on the other hand, for the view of the continuum that it provides; the continuum cannot be explained entirely in terms of the discrete,  which is as it should be.  Dual numbers really should be taught in high-school, as well as intuitionistic logic.\r\n\r\nFor that matter, I've had enough of people calling sqrt(-1) an \"imaginary\" number. It's not. Here it is:\r\n\r\n0 -1\r\n1 0\r\n\r\nThe square of that is\r\n\r\n-1 0\r\n0 -1\r\n\r\nwhich is of course -I, where I is the unit. \"Complex\" numbers are just 2x2 matrices\r\n\r\na -b\r\nb a\r\n\r\nPeople joke that math is just 'castles floating in the air', and 'a religion', but that's because teachers don't talk about these well known constructions that completely ground the subject, and lead to a better understanding."
