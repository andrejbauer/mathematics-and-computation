message: "Since we're working with constructive maths, it's worth pointing out that you can construct $dx$ such that $dx \\cdot dx = 0$ quite easily. Consider the $2 \\times 2$ matrix\n$$\\begin{matrix}\n0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0\n\\end{matrix}$$\nIts square is zero. Now an ordinary number $a$ is\n$$\\begin{matrix}\na & 0 \\\\\n0 & a\n\\end{matrix}$$\nand $a + dx$ is\n$$\\begin{matrix}\na & 1 \\\\\n0 & a\n\\end{matrix}$$\nNow simply carry out $(a + dx)^2$ using ordinary linear algebra. You will get\n$$\\begin{matrix}\na^2 & 2 a \\\\\n0 & a^2\n\\end{matrix}$$\nwhich shows that $2 a dx$ is correct. This'll work for $x^n$ as well as everything else. You just need to expand the definition of 'number' to $2 \\times 2$ matrices. Also look at nilpotent Lie groups for the multivariate case."
