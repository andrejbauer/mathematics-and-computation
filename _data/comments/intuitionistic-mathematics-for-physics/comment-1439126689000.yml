message: "Your suggestion is a well known one. If I am not mistaken you're just suggesting that we work in the ring $\\mathbb{R}[x,y]/(y^2)$, but you're giving us the ring in terms of matrix represenations. This gives us the infinitesimals, but not everything. For example, in synthetic differential geometry the smooth reals $R$ form an (intuitionistic) ordered field, but you've only got a ring. There are also more global obstacles to be overcome. For instance, the total tangent space of <em>any</em> object $A$ is simply the exponential $A^\\Delta$. To get these sorts of features you would have to add a lot more structure to your setup, and I think by the time you'd be done you would invent models of synthetic differential geometry.\n"
