  This is great! I particularly liked the description of how a particle bouncing
  of a wall may require a different notion of the continuum - it reminds me of
  something that I've read about Aristotles close examination of Zenos paradox
  of motion: that the continuum is only potentially infinitely divisible but not
  actually so, and that the continuum is indecomposable; do you happen to know
  how well recieved  intuitionistic concepts of the continuum are in
  interpretations of QM?
