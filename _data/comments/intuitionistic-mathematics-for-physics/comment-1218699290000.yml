message: "First of all, great post!\r\n\r\nI had encountered intuitionistic maths before and thought \"more mathematical logicians playing games with definitions\". As I did more computer science I could see why one would like to use constructive maths but the mathematician in me thought proof by contradiction was too large a sacrifice to make.\r\n\r\nRecently, I read about <a href=\"http://conflate.net/inductio/2008/06/constructive-and-classical-mathematics/\" rel=\"nofollow\">a non-constructive proof</a> that there are irrational and b such that ab is rational. This pushed me further away from the non-constructive viewpoint. \r\n\r\nI think the treatment of infinitesimals you describe to has sent me over the line to the intuitionist camp. Furthermore, it provides a logically sound basis to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation\" rel=\"nofollow\">automatic differentiation</a> using dual numbers - exactly the nilpotent infinitesimals of second degree you talk about.\r\n\r\nThat said, I'm still uncomfortable with the interpretation of the absolute value function. Could you please expand on this some more? Does it have any relationship with your <a href=\"http://math.andrej.com/2006/03/27/sometimes-all-functions-are-continuous/\" rel=\"nofollow\">earlier post</a> in which you talk about all computable functions being continuous?"
