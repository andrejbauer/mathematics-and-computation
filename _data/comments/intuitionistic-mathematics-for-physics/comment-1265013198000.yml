message: "Dear Matthew, the math we are talking about here is at about advanced undergraduate level. It would help if you knew the basics of calculus. For a super-quick and dirty course in calculus I would probably recommend one of Schaum's outline series books, perhaps <a href=\"http://www.mhprofessional.com/product.php?isbn=0071412115\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"Calculus demystified\"</a>, but before you cough up 20 dollars for that book have a look at the <a href=\"http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Calculus\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikibooks Calculus</a>.\n\nSince you are coming from the philosophical angle I definitely suggest that you have a look at Erret Bishop's manifesto, which is the introduction to his Foundations of Constructive Analysis.\n\nIt is a complete lie that you have to study classical mathematics in order to be able to later get to intuitionistic mathematics. Quite the contrary, once your brain has been trained how to use the law of excluded middle it is a real effort to deprogram yourself and be able to reason constructively. Your teachers were just trying to shut you up."
