message: "Having read the invitation by Bell that you link to I can see why things appear strange to me. In particular, the notion of the \"indecomposability\" of the intuitionist's reals is what appears to be behind the lack of discontinuities. Furthermore, you cannot define the absolute value function in the usual way because that presupposes being able to split the reals at 0.\n\nMy ideas of continuity are tied up with the point set topology I studied many years ago. I think I will have to rethink several basic definitions, such as open and closed sets, in light of intuitionist logic to better understand what's going on here."
