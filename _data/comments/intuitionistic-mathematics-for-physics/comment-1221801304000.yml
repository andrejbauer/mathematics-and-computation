  Is it fair to say "non-zero infinitesimals potentially exist" (which I would
  parse as Â¬Â¬âˆƒdxâˆˆR [Â¬(dx = 0) âˆ§ dx^2 = 0])? I would actually take this
  to be provably false (as an intuitionistic field, non-zeros should be the same
  as invertibles, and thus be closed under squaring). It seems the more accurate
  statement would be "not all infinitesimals are zero" (which I would parse as
  Â¬âˆ€dxâˆˆR [dx^2 = 0 =&gt; dx = 0]). But perhaps I should just use a
  different translation from ordinary language to formal intuitionistic logic...
