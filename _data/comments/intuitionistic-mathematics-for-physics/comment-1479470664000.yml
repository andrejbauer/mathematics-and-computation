  Wherever did you get the idea that logic is outside mathematics? Anyhow, you
  should read $\mathsf{Prop}$ as the set of all truth values, not the set of all
  formulas. In other words $\mathsf{Prop}$ is isomorphic to the powerset of a
  singleton $\mathcal{P}(\lbrace\star\rbrace)$. For instance, you can express
  excluded middle as $\forall S \in \mathcal{P}(\lbrace\star\rbrace) . \star \in
  S \lor \lnot (\star \in S)$. Does that make you happier?
