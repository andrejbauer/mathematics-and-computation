message: "Dear Jasper, I am glad you are interested in this topic. My post is not intended to be a complete description of intuitionistic logic and infinitesimal analysis. It is quite impossible to learn these topics just from my post, so I recommend that you look at the literature cited in the post, especially the \"Primer\" by John Bell.\n\nRegarding your comments, let me just say that my post contains at least one error. Namely, the interpretation of `x != y` should be <i>apartness</i> rather than inequality. By this I mean that `x != y` is defined as `x < y or y < x`, rather than the classical `not (x = y)`. I thank Sridhar Ramesh for noticing the problem.\n\nLet me also comment briefly on what you wrote. Firstly, in comment 11, I am not sure what the purpose of the beginning of the post is: you assume A is true and false at the same time, so no wonder you can get anything you like out of that.\n\nYes, the principle of micro-affinity states that the derivative is unique, I did not write that clearly enough. The Law of Cancellation is proved from the Axiom of Micro-Affinity, see John Bell's primer. When I speak of \"arbitrary\" infinitesimals in the Law of Cancellation, what I mean is that in order to cancel `dx` in an equation `a * dx = b * dx` you first have to prove `forall dx, dx^2 = 0 => a * dx = b * dx`, which is <i>not</i> the usual law of cancellation `forall a, b, c, c != 0 and a * c = b * c => a = b`.\n\nThere are meta-theorems saying that the usual derivatives are the same as the ones developed in smooth analysis, again see John Bell's Primer. Further, if `dx^2 = 0` then `not (dx != 0)`, i.e., you cannot have an infinitesimal which is apart from 0. So when you assumed that you had one like that, of course you can derive anything, among other things your `dx < 0 or dx > 0`. If `dx` is infinitesimal then `-1/n < dx < 1/n` for all natural numbers `n`, i.e., this is what we mean when we say that infinitesimals are \"infinitely small\".\n\nI am not sure what you mean by those `f`-infinitesimals. I think you should think more carefully about them and make sure you do not use classical logic on the way. "
