  Also, my impression that the relevant notion of "intuitionistic field" was one
  in which "Â¬(x = 0) iff x is invertible" came from, for example, the last
  field axiom in section R_1 of p. 102 of Bell's "A Primer of Infinitesimal
  Analysis". Of course, I understand now that there are also other reasonable
  conceptions of intuitionistic fields, but this would seem to be the one at use
  in at least Bell's formulation of smooth infinitesimal analysis.
