message: "Answer to Sridhar: it is not true that in an intuitionistic field non-zeros coincide with invertibles. In intuitionistic algebra we  use <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartness_relation\" rel=\"nofollow\">apartness relation</a>, which is a constructivized version of non-equality, rather than non-equality itself. Thus the axiom about invertible elements in the field is \"if `x` is apart from zero, then it is invertible\" (and not \"if `x` is not zero, then it is invertible).\r\n\r\nConcretely, in an ordered field apartness is defined as: `x` and `y` are apart iff `x &lt; y` or `x > y`. So you can only invert an element if you know that it is negative or positive. It does not generally follow that every non-zero element is negative or positive (I actually mention this issue in the post above). I hope that answers your question.\r\n\r\nIn the case of smooth reals we can show that for every infinitesimal `x` we have \"`x` is not apart from zero\". So you cannot have an invertible infinitesimal (although there are variants of the axioms of smooth analysis which give you that)."
