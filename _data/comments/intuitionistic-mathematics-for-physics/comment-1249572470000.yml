message: "I feel like i have poked a hole in it. Something that is potentially true might actually be true: Let A be a true statement, now suppose A is false; this conflicts with A being true, so A is not false. So infinitesimals are potentially in danger.\r\n\r\nx0 =&gt; f(x)&gt;0 or f(x)&gt;0\r\nf(0)=0\r\n\r\nSay we have a z, a 'f-infinitessimal': f(z)=0. Then z&gt;0 or z or f(z)f(g(x)) 'h-infinitessimal'. But if f(g(z))=0, if g(z)=0, then f(g(z))= f(0)=0, so it is in there, so the 'g-infinitessimals' are a subset of the 'h-infinitesimals'. Now, make h the identity, for which e(z)=0 implies z=0, you see that for all the infinitesimals based on functions like this are zero; there are no infinitesimals.\r\n\r\nSo... What am i doing wrong?"
