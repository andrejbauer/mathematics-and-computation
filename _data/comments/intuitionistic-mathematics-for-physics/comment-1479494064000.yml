  You say that Prop is in fact not the set of all propositions (= formulas).
  Why, then, do you denote the set of truth values "Prop"? "Prop" immediately
  suggests that it is the set of all propositions.


  You say that I can imagine $\mathsf {Prop}$ to be the set $\mathcal
  P(&#123;\star&#125;)$. But then the law of excluded middle

  $\forall\phi\in\mathsf{Prop}. \, \phi\lor\neg\phi$.

  becomes

  $\forall S\in \mathcal P(&#123;\star&#125;).\, S\lor\neg S$.

  But this latter statement does not make sense, since $S$ is a mathematical
  object and not a statement. Thus one can't use $S$ to express a statement like
  "$S\lor\neg S$". That's where my confusion comes from. I hope you can clarify.
