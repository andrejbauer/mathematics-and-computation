message: "Hello!\r\n\r\nI'm interested in understanding what you've written about.\r\n\r\nI've been convinced of intuitionist logic, philosophically, since taking Logic 101 as an undergrad philosophy major. I don't know how many times I heard the professor say, \"Matthew, we're NOT studying Brouwer!\" I had a great deal of difficulty in that class, in no small part because the law of the excluded middle doesn't make sense to me, and we were expected to reason with it. (I scored a 1530 on the SAT; intelligence wasn't the problem.)\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of this question, let's just say my current level of mathematics proficiency is basic, college-level algebra. (I could use a review.)\r\n\r\nCan you recommend a series of texts I could study, or courses I could take, that would equip me to even understand the \"Primer\" by John Bell?\r\n\r\nI've asked this same question over the years, but the answer I've gotten repeatedly is that I first need to study logics and maths that acknowledge and use the law of the excluded middle... and then I can get into intuitionist logic and math. I'm not interested in doing this. Surely, I keep thinking: there has to be a way for me to learn more logic and math that doesn't require me to turn a blind eye to reality!\r\n\r\nThank you for your suggestions, and thank you for this fine post!"
