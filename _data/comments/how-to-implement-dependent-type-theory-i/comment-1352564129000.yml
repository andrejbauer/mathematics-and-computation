  This is very helpful to see; thank you for doing it!  Of the additional
  enhancements on your list, I think one for which it is least clear to me how
  to go about it is adding a tactic language and/or interactive proof mode. Do
  you have any plans to try that, and/or any hints on how one would go about it?
  Do you have to implement a separate datatype for terms with holes of specified
  types?
