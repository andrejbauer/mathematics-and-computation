  @Charles: I reiterate; I did not presume <strong>anything</strong> about
  computability or existence of infinite binary streams of our universe when I
  said "computers can represent all infinite binary streams of our universe".
  Also, because the proof that there are uncountably many infinite binary
  streams is constructive, it works no matter what we assume about computability
  of infinite binary streams.
