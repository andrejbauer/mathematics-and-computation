message: "You are quite correct that I was a bit hasty in dragging in the Verification principle. What actually matters is whether the laws of physics predict existence or non-existence of computable streams, not what we can verify in finite time. Also note that there might exist funky experiments that test for existence of non-computable streams in a probabilistic way without actually exhibiting a non-computable stream.\n\nHowever, there does seem to be a difference between \"There exist binary streams with only finitely many 0s\" and \"There exist uncomputable binary streams\", namely that I can produce a mechanism which outputs an infinite stream od 1s and <em>prove</em> from currently accepted laws of physics that it does not contain any 0s (modulo idealizations such as \"the mechanism will not break or run out of energy and time\"). Is it possible to build a mechanism which outputs a binary stream and prove, using currently accepted laws of physics, that it outputs a non-computable stream? Is it possible to prove from currently accepted laws of physics that no such mechanism exists? I suspect the current laws of physics do not say much about either option."
