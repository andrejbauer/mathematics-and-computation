message: "I'm not sure it's fair to say that physicists actually would, on the basis of something like the verification principle, take the question of the possibility of physical generation of non-computable streams to be meaningless. The fact that we can only observe finite prefixes of a binary stream leaves us in a similar position regarding \"There exist binary streams with only finitely many 0s\" as with \"There exist uncomputable binary streams\", does it not? And yet, every physicist would say the former question is settled (by the inductive grounds that lead us to believe certain streams are all 1s).\n\nSimilarly, we could at least potentially imagine concluding, on inductive grounds, that some physical process actually yields, say, a binary stream whose nth value differs from that of the nth program on itself whenever such computation halts. And thus be led to conclude the physical existence of uncomputable binary streams. I don't think such a situation is terribly likely, but only because I, for reasons that are probably more superstition than logic, doubt the world works that way, and thus don't think the requisite sort of empirical evidence will ever be found. However, it seems clear that the methods of scientific practice themselves present no necessary barrier to drawing such a conclusion."
