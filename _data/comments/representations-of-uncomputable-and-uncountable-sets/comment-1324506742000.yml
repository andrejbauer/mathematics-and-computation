  @Steven: The assumption "computers can represent all infinite binary streams
  of our universe" does <i>not</i> presume anything about existence of such
  streams. So I do not see why your remark is relevant at all. Moreover, I think
  that discussions of the kind "Is there an infinite stream in our universe?"
  are a bit pointless unless the concepts involved are very well defined,
  otherwise one can always defend his position by saying "that depends on what
  you mean by 'is'".
