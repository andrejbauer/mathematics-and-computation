message: "andrej&gt; The assumption “computers can represent all infinite binary streams of our universe” does not presume anything about existence of such streams.\r\n\r\nWell, you are quite right to call Steven in on his inference, but this does presuppose (since here we no doubt presuppose Church--Turing) that infinite streams are at least recursive, which is a nontrivial claim.  Consider the incompatible claim that there are infinite streams in nature, but that these all are nondeterministic.  It does seem to me to be defensible."
