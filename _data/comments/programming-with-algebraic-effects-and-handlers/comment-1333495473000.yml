message: "I said \"assuming\" because you said \"typical.\" If it's a consequence, then it's not the typical way, it's the only way. Since it's the only way, I don't see the orthogonality that is broken.\n\nAnyway, this is all very nitpicky. We read your paper in our reading club at Utrecht, and one of the comments that came up was that it was fuzzy how computations and expressions were distinguished. Now that I understand how you get from a computation to an expression, it's more clear. But I think something could possibly be improved in the explanation."
