message: "Two comments:\n\n1. It's unnecessarily confusing that you use <code>c</code> for built-in constants <em>and</em> computations, esp. since there is only a short phrase mentioning the first. Can you choose another metavariable for constants?\n\n2. I'm confused about the typing of <code>e#op</code>, both in its own rule and in the handler rule. The only way to get an effect type <code>E</code> seems to be by introducing a computation with <code>new</code>, which is typed with the $\\vdash_c$ judgment, but the aforementioned rules with <code>e#op</code> require typing the effect <code>e</code> with $\\vdash_e$ judgment.\n\n"
