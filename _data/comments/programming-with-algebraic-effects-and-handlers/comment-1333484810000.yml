  @Sean: Thanks for the comments. Regarding constants, yes of course, that is an
  unecessary slip up on our part. Regarding your second point: you are right, so
  the typical way of getting a <code>e#op</code> is to write something like
  <code>let x = new E in .... x#op ..</code>. What did you expect? You could
  write <code>(new E)#op</code> in concrete syntax, but that would be useless
  and also it would be desugared into <code>let x = new E in x#op</code>.
