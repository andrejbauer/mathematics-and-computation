message: "Resources do not have access to the continuation, while ordinary handlers do.\n\nIt makes little sense for a \"top-level handler\" to be able to manipulate the continuation, since the continuation is open-ended in nature, i.e., it is not delimited. But this is not why we defined resources. We defined resources as a direct implementation of the theoretical idea of co-models."
