  I am not "assuming" that a variable will be used in <code>e#op</code>. Rather,
  this is a <b>consequence</b> of the fact that the syntax does not have any
  exprssions of effect types, other than variables. I don't think anything would
  be simplified if we restricted <code>e</code> in <code>e#op</code> to
  variables. We would just break orthogonality, so this does not sound like a
  good idea to me.
