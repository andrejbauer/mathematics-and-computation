  Ugh, this is a very very old post. Mathematica has changed since then and I am
  sure a lot of what I was cirticizing has been fixed. In any case, I think
  Mathematica is taking a different route than proof assistants. It's more about
  knowledge management in the machine-learning sense of the word than about
  mechanised mathematics.
