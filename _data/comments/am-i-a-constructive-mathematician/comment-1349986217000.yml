If you have some pointers, I’d be grateful.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nSpeaking as a computer scientist, I certainly hope this statement is false! IMO, the contribution of computer science to logic is that it has helped us finally take a step out of Frege's shadow. That is, I see Frege's invention of predicate logic as a bit like the development of photosynthesis: it was a stupendous advance, which triggered a mass extinction of a variety of other conceptions of logic. Things that had been part of logic, like causality, intention, and inductive inference, went into eclipse since our old methods could not compete with the sophistication of the model-theoretic, truth-functional approach. Intuitionism, plus Gentzen and Prawitz's proof-theoretic approach, plus their applications to computer science, at long last give us alternative conceptions of logic strong enough and useful enough to stand as an alternative to the traditional approach. \r\n\r\nBut I dearly hope that this is not the end of the story! Seeing how incredibly profitable the notion of construction has been, I wonder how much more we can enrich our notion of logic if we allow causation and dialectic and so on back in. (Heck, even Frege still offers us obviously-important ideas that we lack a good formal model of, like the distinction between sense and reference.)"
