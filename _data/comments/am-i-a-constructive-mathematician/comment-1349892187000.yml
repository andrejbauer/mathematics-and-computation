message: "@Dr. Bauer\n\n\"Part of my relativist position is, and this I want to stress, that the relative points of view cannot be reconciled. One possible world is Platonism.\"\n\nHow do you mean \"possible world\"?  The pre-eminent theoretician of possiblilia was David Lewis, and, according to him, all possible worlds have the same abstract entities.  It seems incoherent to call Platonism a \"possible mathematical world\" - if Platonism is true, then there are no other possible mathematical worlds.\n\n@ Marc\n\n\"Platonism is a philosophical position with respect to ontology. Gödel proved an epistemological fact: some truths aren’t knowable. What is the difference between a truth that exists and one that doesn’t if you can’t possibly know it?\"\n\nFirst, that the \"truth\" that doesn't exist doesn't exist, and the one that does exist does exist.  That is a clear difference.  Second, a \"truth\" that doesn't exist is not true.\n\n\"Different foundations posit both different ontologies (what kinds of mathematical objects exist) and different epistemologies ( proof systems ). How are you going to distinguish the relative “mathematical truth” of one or the other?\"\n\nSuch considerations would have to be based on other philosophical positions.  However, if you privilege one, as you privilege computation, then you cannot coherently believe in relativism.\n\n@ Paul\n\n\"The arrogance of classical mathematicians is not just that they think that their world is the only real one (despite plenty of evidence to the contrary since Godel and Cohen) but that their accounts of the arguments are the definitive ones.\"\n\nHow can more than one world be real?"
