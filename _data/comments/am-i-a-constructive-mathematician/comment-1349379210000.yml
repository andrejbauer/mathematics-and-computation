message: "Neel, Paul,\r\n\r\nthanks, this is going in the kind of direction that I am after, yes. \r\n\r\nTo make this more concrete, maybe we can create a table displaying part of the \"hierarchy of foundations\", starting with the most basic natural deduction framework/basic logic (or whatever), and successively adding axioms. \r\n\r\nI gave it a try on <a href=\"http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/layers+of+foundations\" rel=\"nofollow\">this page</a>. This is to provoke reactions (on your parts) and generate insight (on my part) not to claim anything."
