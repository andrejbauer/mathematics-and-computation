  Thanks for reminding me about overtness, I included it in my list. Regarding
  "pluralist" versus "relativist", I think I want to stick with "relativist"
  even though I also like the other one. For me pluralism would mean
  acknowledgment of many worlds of mathematics, while I also want to make a
  claim about points of view. The mathematical method (or language, or a way of
  thinking) itself is part of a world of mathematics. For example, a
  type-theorist and a classical set-theorist use (somewhat) different formalisms
  and language. Consequently they each see the multiverse of mathematics from
  their own points of view, and this is where <b>relativism</b> comes in: there
  is no "absolute coordinate system" in the multiverse of mathematics. Views of
  the multiverse are relative to where we stand, and they are irreconcilable.
  Now that is a philosophical point of view!
