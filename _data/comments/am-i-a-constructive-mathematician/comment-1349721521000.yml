  Political correctness has no place in mathematics.  Would GÃ¶del have been more
  productive as a "pluralist" than a Platonist?  No; as he explained, his
  Platonism was the reason he was able to discover incompleteness.  If there
  exists mathematical truth, then pluralism is not augmentation - it is
  dilution.
