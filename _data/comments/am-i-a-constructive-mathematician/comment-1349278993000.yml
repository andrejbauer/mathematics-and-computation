message: "Recently we were discussing something related with Mike Shulman, Ulrik Buchholtz and others on the nForum, when I kept asking (foundational layman that I am), questions like the following:\r\n\r\nOn the one hand I am very happy with the view that you are promoting: there is no good reason to exclusively consider some axioms and exclusively disregard others. All of them are mathematics.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I am wondering if there is not, after all, some joint common basis of all systems that we will recognize as being mathematics. Some absolute minimum of formal mathematical reasoning in which we are able to speak of any formal axiom in the first place!\r\n\r\nMaybe the principles of \"natural deduction\" themselves? Before we specify any _particular_ formation/introduction/elimination rules, but after we agree on what a valid set of formation rules should be?\r\n\r\nFor consider your example at the very end of the above post, concerning set theory and homotopy type theory: neither should have a monopoly, yes. But also: _both_ of them you can implement in, say, Coq! So somehow there is something more foundational than _both_ of them which subsumes them.\r\n\r\nUlrik and Mike eventually suggested that what I am after is the notion of \"logical framework\". I am not sure yet, mainly because it is not becomeing entirely clear to me what _exactly_ people mean when they speak about logical frameworks, and if they even all mean the same thing. (Mike said that he may have carried part of this discussion to the IAS, so maybe you have heard an echo of what I am trying to ask here recently, I don't know).\r\n\r\nWhile I feel strongly that I'd like to know the answer to what I am asking here, I feel just as strongly that I am probably not expert enough to formulate it properly. So if what I am saying here does not quite make sense to you, but if it reminds you of something that does make sense to you, then I'd be grateful if you could comment on that. Thanks!"
