message: "@Merlin: you are almost hitting the gist of my position. I am precisely attacking the assumption that \"there must still be something that they [mathematical worlds] have something in common that entitles us to call them mathematical\". No, that restores absolutism. Instead, I put forward the thesis that each mathematical world has its own idea of what all the worlds have in common. Of course, this leads to the (quite realistic) possibility that the various mathematical worlds disagree about what the various mathematical worlds are. What counts as mathematics in one world might not in another! For example, some mathematicians would refuse to call \"mathematics\" a development of mathematics based on paraconsistent logic (and some do). Or some mathematicians would declare unfettered use of impredicativity meaningless, and so they would declare many kinds of mathematics as meaningless (I know some who are at least suspicious of impredicativity). I see no reason why such a position is problematic. As far as I can see it does not follow from this that \"anything goes\". Actually, it problably does, but only in some worlds. I am hopelessly relativist, and I do not have a problem with it. I do have a problem with the assumption that mathematics is absolute. It is not. It is a man-made artefact ridden with historic accidents. When the aliens land we will be quite surprised that they have mathematics which is nothing like what humans ever imagined it to be.\r\n\r\nHowever, giving up on a relativist position as unanalyzable or unmathematical is like giving up on studying infinity on the presumption that it is somehow unanalyzable. A challenge is presented here. How do we make sense of the fact that there are many mathematical worlds, without an absolute common basis? If phsycists could do it, we can do it too."
