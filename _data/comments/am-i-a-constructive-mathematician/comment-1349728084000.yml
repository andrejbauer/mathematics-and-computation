message: "Ivan, I don't know what you mean by Political Correctness in this context, but surely before Pluralism takes on the technical meanings that we have been discussing, it first means that the world is a richer place through having people with many different points of view in it.\n\nI fully understand that a mathematician who sees himself \"at the coalface\" or following his ancestral instincts to hunt wild animals will find it easier to do so by believing that the world is real and chasing down his counterexample to kill it.  Indeed, Lobachevsky and Bishop would not have achieved what they did without a pretty thorough grounding in classical geometry or analysis.\n\nHowever, the fascinating and unexplained thing about mathematics is that the arguments survive even when you turn the world upside down by swapping theorems with definitions or taking the basic intuitions away.  For example, a polynomial has a multiple zero iff both it and its derivative vanish -- even in a field of finite characteristic, making limits and rates of change meaningless.\n\nThe arrogance of classical mathematicians is not just that they think that their world is the only real one (despite plenty of evidence to the contrary since Godel and Cohen) but that their accounts of the arguments are the definitive ones.\n\nIntuitistic mathematicians do not \"rob\" their classical colleagues of their theorems, as Hilbert alleged, but nuture and polish them. Often there are many intuitionistic notions (for example with <a href=http://www.paultaylor.eu/ordinals#intso rel=\"nofollow\">ordinals</a>) or theorems where there was only one classical one.  Andrej is better able than me to give you examples of things that <i>only</i> exist in delicately constructed intuitionistic worlds."
