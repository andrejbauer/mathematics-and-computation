message: "Andrej, I agree that it makes no sense, in most cases, to identify objects from different universes. However this is precisely what happens if I'm not careful with my terminology. If I stop making these (I suppose linguistic) distinctions, then there simply is no context from which you can infer what I'm actually talking about.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you can comment on the following scenario: starting with a model of set theory, I force to collapse $\\aleph_1$. What do I call things in the extension? In particular, at what point and how does my old $\\aleph_1$ lose the right to be called that?\r\nSlightly more tongue-in-cheek, I ask you, with the millions and millions of models of PA running around, all of them equally plausible, how could anyone pretend that one of them is special? And yet we talk about such things as true arithmetic.\r\n(I hope you don't mind too much that I seem to have somehow provoked some kind of argument on your otherwise very presentable blog. Also, are you implying that I'm no longer a little mathematician boy?)\r\n\r\nPaul, I am outraged that there could be a triangle whose angles don't sum up to 180°. However, this is because to me (and most of the mathematical community, I should think) a triangle is a certain arrangement of straight line segments in the Euclidean plane, where the angle thing is just a theorem. To be clear, I have no problem with the fact that there are object which are very similar to triangles in certain respects, but the sum of whose internal angles isn't 180°. What I do have a problem with is freely calling these things triangles. I think statements of the type \"There is a triangle whose angles don't sum up to 180°,\" are wordplay and what mathematical content they posses could have been conveyed much more clearly and, dare I say, correctly.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I admit I don't really care what people call their concepts among themselves. I will, however, insist on some sort of accommodation if they want to talk to me about them.\r\n\r\nAlso, the doomsaying about the death of classical mathematics. A bit strong, don't you think?"
