  @Miha: Ah, but I am an example of someone who can hold two intervals in his
  head, and not get confused. Of course, the interval cannot be compact and
  non-compact at the same time. But there can be two worlds in which there are
  two intervals, one of them being compact and the other not. And both objects
  have an equal right to be call "the interval". But you are yourself quite
  familiar with a situation which is not much different. Just consider the fact
  that $\aleph_1$ may be this or that, depending on what model of set theory
  you're in. Both deserve to be called $\aleph_1$, but they may have different
  properties. I don't think it make sense to brand one of them as being somehow
  "pseudo".
