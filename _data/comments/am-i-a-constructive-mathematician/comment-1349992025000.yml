message: "@Neel\n\n<blockquote>Frege still offers us obviously-important ideas that we lack a good formal model of, like the distinction between sense and reference.</blockquote>\n\nI find your perception that this lack exists surprising.  My own informal sense of this is that you have \"sense\" when you have a constructive process to recognize a unicorn if you found one, and \"reference\" is being able to find a unicorn to be recognized by the sense. What is challenging to account for, given that formulation?"
