  @Ivan: Part of my relativist position is, and this I want to stress, that the
  relative points of view cannot be reconciled. One possible world is Platonism.
  From that world my relativism looks like model theory, with the additional
  (false) claim that models are just as good as the ideal world of mathematics.
  Notice that we are not talking mathematics or logic here, because we are
  saying that some world/models are "more real" than others. I am not advocating
  that all mathematicians should adopt my view, as that of course would be a
  form of absolutism. I still can believe that my view will be prevalent in due
  time (for economic reasons pointed out by Paul), and I took the liberty of
  admonishing Miha because I have known him personally since he was just a
  little mathematician boy.
