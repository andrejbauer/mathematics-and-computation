message: "Paul Taylor wrote:\r\n\r\n<cite>Non-classical mathematics is useful in computer science, which is useful to the economy and so attracts funding, which classical pure mathematics increasingly does not.</cite>\r\n\r\nCan you point me to some document that substantiatiates this statement with empirical studies, with numbers or the like? \r\n\r\n(I don't doubt the truth of the statement! But all the more would it be nice to have a proof in case I run into somebody who does doubt it. If you have some pointers, I'd be grateful.)"
