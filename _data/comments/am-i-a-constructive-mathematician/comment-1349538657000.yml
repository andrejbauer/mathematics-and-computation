message: "Andrej, no, neither of them deserves to be called $\\aleph_1$, or rather neither of them deserves to be called just $\\aleph_1$, precisely because they may have different properties. People place all sorts of decorations on their cardinals to avoid this sort of confusion. Since the relativist position cannot choose a preferred canonical model (or framework), these distinctions are necessary. The same would go for the interval example.\n\nAles, I agree that mathematicians have no trouble identifying isomorphic objects. The trouble is that we are now asking them to identify objects with very different properties. They may be the same in some respects, and the people who only care about those properties will happily go along with you, but the other ones will struggle. Of course, if they are familiar with the context this will be easier. But these issues arise even when introducing the context and there another way has to be found. \nAnd I disagree that mathematicians shouldn't be shocked when a term they know is somehow subverted. I see it as entirely reasonable for a person who's dealt with metric spaces all his life (but hasn't seen a topological space, say) to be outraged if I come along and start calling some non-Hausdorff thing a metric space (even if I've just slightly weakened his definition of a metric).\n\nI've been trying to figure out whether the names mathematicians use for their concepts are rigid or definitional or what. The fact is that concepts carry all sorts of baggage (the interval is not only the set of points between 0 and 1, but is also compact, connected, a dense order etc.), even if people don't admit it, and this has to be taken into account."
