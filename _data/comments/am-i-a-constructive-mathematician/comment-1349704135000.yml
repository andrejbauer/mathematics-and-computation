message: "Miha, are you outraged that there could be triangles whose angles don't add up to $180^\\circ$ or that $-1$ could have a square root?\n\nAre you going to add codicils to the obvious definition of a triangle to prevent Riemann, Bolyai, Lobachevsky and Einstein from subverting your preconceptions about geometry?\n\nWhy should computer scientists and algebraic geometers whose spaces are not Hausdorff accept your codicil requiring compact subspaces to be closed?  (Or, indeed, Bishop's that they should be overt?)\n\nAs for metric spaces, the symmetric axiom is not needed for the essential development and would seem to be a matter of prejudice.  <a href=\"http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Eric.Goubault/\" / rel=\"nofollow\">Eric Goubault</a> has shown how to develop directed homotopy theory and apply it to computational processes.\n\nThe relativist or pluralist ideas that are controversial now will be accepted as part of the mainstream in due course, exactly as non-Euclidean geometry was by the end of the 19th century.\n\nThere is an economic reason for this: Non-classical mathematics is useful in computer science, which is useful to the economy and so attracts funding, which classical pure mathematics increasingly does not.  Eventually this message will get through to the best 18 year old mathematicians, who will choose to study modern computer science instead of fuddy-duddy mathematics. Then the latter will die.\n\nNor is this new.  The tradition of mathematics has gone under many names (geometry, astronomy, ballistics) in the past, so it will come to be called computer science in the not too distant future. \"Mathematician\" will once again mean an <a href=\"http://www.math.osu.edu/~easwaran.1/augustine.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">astrologer</a>."
