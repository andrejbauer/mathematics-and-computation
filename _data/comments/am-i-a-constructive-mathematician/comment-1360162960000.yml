  While I am sympathetic with the idea that there are many meaningful ways to
  consider e.g. the continuum, this view has, as far as I see, the same problem
  as any relativistic/pluralistic account: Even if there are many "mathematical
  worlds", there must still be something that they have in common and that
  entitles us to call them "mathematical". This something then provides a
  single, unifying foundation of mathematics that we should strive to grasp and
  describe. The pluralism can in this context take a methodological function by
  preventing us from assuming that our current working notion is ultimate and
  cannot be corrected or improved any more.
