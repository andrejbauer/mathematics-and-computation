  @Miha: Now that you got a deserved beating from Paul, let me just point out
  that it makes very little sense to identify two objects which live in
  different universes. So this has nothing to do with confusing two different
  concepts. There is $\aleph_1$ in this model and $\aleph_1$ in that model. Both
  are defined as <b>the least uncountable ordinal</b>. This is a valid
  definition because it fixes the set $\aleph_1$ up to a unique set (I am
  assuming standard ZF-style treatment of ordinals). What we have to get over
  with is that a definite description might fix an object but it does not fix
  its relation to other objects. This should be obvious, as the "other objects"
  depend on what universe we are in. The whole point of forcing is to produce
  other models of set theory. With the millions and millions of set theory
  models running around, all of them equally plausible, how could anyone pretend
  that one of them is special?
