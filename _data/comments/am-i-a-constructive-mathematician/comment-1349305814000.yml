message: "As a happy user of many kinds of non-rigorous mathematics I'm not sure it can be said that I take a formalist view :-)\r\n\r\nI like Paul's pluralist picture. I think it also suggests an interesting line of research. He suggests that Physics uses certain results like the compactness of [0,1]. Determining what axioms are needed by theorems is the subject of reverse mathematics. So I wonder if reverse mathematics should be extended to physics to find out what physicists need. (Unfortunately for this idea, real arguments in physics aren't always purely mathematical so it's not clear if this can be done usefully.)"
