  @Urs: If I am reading correctly the data in <a
  href="http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf12318/pdf/nsf12318.pdf"
  rel="nofollow">this NSF report</a>, see for example Table 19, computer science
  and mathematics together get a miniscule amount of money compared to life
  sciences, the ratio is 1 to 10. Then within the CS+math clump CS gets 2.6 as
  much money as mathematics. Now suppose 10% of computer scientists "do math".
  This would then account for roughly a quarter of all the money that
  mathematicians get, so "CS math" is an important "branch" of mathematics. And
  I am not even considering private funding, of which CS gets a lot and math
  very little. But I think "CS math" is still smaller than "applied math",
  although I don't have data on that. If following the money is the right thing
  to do, smart young mathematicians should be doing biology and medicine.
