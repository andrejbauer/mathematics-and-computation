Since they do radical things to the context and the notion of hypothesis, I think any structural invariants capable of encompassing the variety of proof systems we know will be either very weak or very abstract. Noam Zeilberger (who will be at IAS for the homotopy year) has worked with Paul-Andre Mellies on this problem, so he can probably tell you many interesting things about this. (He has mentioned to me that there are connections between cut elimination and Isbell duality.)"
