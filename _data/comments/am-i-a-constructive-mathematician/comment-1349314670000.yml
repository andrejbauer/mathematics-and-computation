  @Russell: because many programs compute the same real yor argument only shows
  that the (computable) reals form a subquotient of the natural numbers. To get
  an actual subset you need to pick canonical codes for reals, in a computable
  way, and that is not possible. So, if we are playing the computable game, you
  lose: there is no computable embedding of computable reals into the natural
  numbers.
