message: "Andrej, \r\nI share your feeling that relativist/pluralist position is useful from a purely mathematical point of view, but would you acknowledge that certain views are more \"in accordance with the real world\", at least for particular purposes.\r\n\r\nFor example, some foundations may be more useful for thinking about computation, or physics or some other domain, while others may be completely un-useful for the same purpose."
