message: "@Ivan: I think I mispoke there a bit (but only a bit) when I said that \"Platonism is one possible world\". You see, to <b>me</b> Platonism is one possible world, but of course to a Platonist that is non-sense. Which is why my philosophical position is a position, not just an idle remark that everyone can agree with. The question then is how to \"speak across the worlds\" (something that I find extremely interesting). To speak to a Platonist, I would have to water it down by saying \"Platonism is one of the views of mathematics that people hold\", which establishes the fact that there are many worlds of mathematics only in the sense that people have opinions (which can therefore be false and mistaken, except of course for the Platonist one). So if you are happier with my saying \"personal view of mathematics\" instead of \"mathematical world\", read it that way. To put in derogatory terms: to a person who can see the other worlds Platonists are like two-dimensional beings that deny, or cannot comprehend, the existence of the third dimension; consequently it is difficult to discuss certain topics with them. By the way, I think your pronouncements on existence and non-existence of truth make no sense, especially when you equate \"non-existence of truth\" with \"falsehood\".\r\n\r\n@Miha: I think you are discovering the imprtance of <b>speaking in context</b>.  When I say \"the cow\" you need some context to know which one I mean. It is exactly the same with $\\aleph_1$. And that is all there is about it, becaues the same argument applies to triangles. There is such a thing as a universe of discourse, which matters, especially when we switch from one universe to another. Of course when you speak about several models at once you will need to distinguish between this and that $\\aleph_1$, but they are both still just $\\aleph_1$, each in its own world. All this is a bit complicated and difficult to disentangle because humans are used to the context being implicit. We usually guess the context in which communication should happen, and to a large extent connected communities of people share a common context that is good for most purposes.\r\n\r\nYou also asked about \"the standard model of PA\". I think you can view this in two ways. The easy way out is to say that \"the standard model of PA\" is just some unspecified model in which we are working. But this really just circumvents the question. I think it is evident that we cannot <b>really</b> know which model of PA is the standard model, nor can we know whether \"your\" model is the same as \"mine\". In fact I don't think either of us actually holds a model of PA in his mind, at least not in any real sense. Perhaps as some sort of a higher-primate approximation of the thing that a model is supposed to be (although you have the advantage of being a couple of inches taller than I am, so not a boy anymore). My solution is to admit that there are in fact millions and millions of models of PA, all slightly different, <b>but</b> informal mathematics does not happen in any one of them. Informal mathematics is a human activity, of which formal logic is an approximation (or the other way around, if you are a die-hard logician with poor social skills).\r\n\r\nPerhaps I should think more carefully about a relativist position with respect to mathematics as a human activity vs. relativist position as the philosophical position of admitting that there are many equally valid \"realities\" of mathematics (if you just saw scare quotes you are a Platonist). On the other hand, I can probably explain everything using relativism. Some people will view mathematics as a human activity, and they would think that is what I am talking about, while others will consider this discussion to be about actual mathematics, and will undertand \"mathematical world\" as topos, or model of ZF, or a logic, etc. I would say that the pluralism of human mathematics is being reflected by its mathematical idealization."
