  I somehow feel that the major problem here is one of equivocation. Naturally,
  most mathematicians will balk at you announcing "The interval [0,1] is not
  compact," (even if you precede that with "I have found a framework in
  which..."). On the other hand, saying "The pseudointerval [0,1] is not
  compact," will result in a much more amiable response, even if no one has any
  idea what a pseudointerval is and how it relates to the standard interval. The
  mathematical content is the same, but the social (or linguistic, if you like)
  content is vastly different. I also don't think this only happens in
  interactions between multiple mathematicians. In fact, I'm sure that if there
  were a single Mathematician and he were considering intervals and
  pseudointervals simultaneously, he would become very confused very quickly if
  he did not start making some distinction between them (in his mind or
  wherever).
