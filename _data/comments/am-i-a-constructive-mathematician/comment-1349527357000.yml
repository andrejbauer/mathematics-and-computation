  Miha, I don't think that just the "proper" interval should be called the
  interval and others prepended with some modifier. At the risk of over
  generalizing, the situation doesn't seem different than all the other
  identifications that mathematicians make all the time, for example with
  different notions of continuity in different theories. The disambiguation then
  comes from the context in which the expression occurs and this should be no
  different when considering more foundational issues. A mathematician shouldn't
  be shocked when presented with things called intervals which don't have
  property P dear to him, just as he isn't when compact sets turn out not to be
  closed.
