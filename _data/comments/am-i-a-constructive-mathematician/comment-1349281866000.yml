message: "Marc,\n\nIt's not really about what's \"in accordance with the real world\". Formal systems are there to be plundered in any way you can. They don't come automatically equipped with a set of rules that says how to align a mathematical world with the real world so you can judge whether one is more in accordance with another. ZF is fairly poor at modelling bags of groceries despite the fact that sets are conceptually like containers, nonetheless I know how to use various theorems of ZF to predict how certain physical systems behave and hence convince my employers to pay me. Neither of these examples mean that ZF is more or less accordance in the world."
