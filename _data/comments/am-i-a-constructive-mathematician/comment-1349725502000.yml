message: "@Ivan: Platonism is a philosophical position with respect to ontology. GÃ¶del proved an epistemological fact: some truths aren't knowable. What is the difference between a truth that exists and one that doesn't if you can't possibly know it?\r\n\r\nDifferent foundations posit both different ontologies (what kinds of mathematical objects exist) and different epistemologies ( proof systems ).  How are you going to distinguish the relative \"mathematical truth\" of one or the other?\r\n\r\nI personally privilege computational truth (which is somewhat objective) as the basis for mathematics, but I have to acknowledge that this is a philosophical (and practical) decision that lies outside of mathematics <i>per se</i>."
