message: "Dan, thanks your your support for my idea of obtaining axioms from theorems, but please don't associate me with the phrase \"Reverse Mathematics\".\r\n\r\nSo far as I understand it, and I am willing to be corrected, this takes the framework of an $\\in$ relation axiomatised in a first order way as given, and then switches the particular axioms on and off according as they are needed for significant statements in mathematics.\r\n\r\nFollowing my computer component metaphor, this is like saying that the image on the screen has to be formed by a scanning electron gun, so that the job is to tweak the analogue circuits to do this better. In fact, that was my father's career, but he is dead now and we have a completely different technology.\r\n\r\nIn principle, therefore, everything in Foundations must be up for grabs. In practice, at a particular moment in history, we have to start from the (meta)technology that we currently have available. In <a href=http://www.paultaylor.eu/ASD/foufct/cat+type rel=\"nofollow\">section 2</a> of <i>Foundations for Computable Topology</i>, I proposed, not introduction and elimination rules, or adjunctions, but the fact that these are equivalent, as the meta-technology."
