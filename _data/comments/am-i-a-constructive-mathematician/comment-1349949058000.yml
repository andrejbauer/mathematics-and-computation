message: "@miha: making another comparison to your suggestion that we should call intervals in other models “pseudointervals”, how would you feel about the statement “2 is prime”?  It is true in <b><i>Z</i></b>, but not in e.g. the Gaussian integers.  I am confident that most mathematicians, asked “Is 2 prime?” would at first say “yes”, since <b><i>Z</i></b> is the default setting for these concepts, but that when reminded of the Gaussian integers, they would happily agree that in other rings, 2 may or may not be prime.  They would not feel the need to say “pseudo-2” or “pseudo-prime”; they would just say that the statement “2 is prime” can be interpreted in multiple ways.  That does not make “2 is prime” an imprecise statement: as long as one stays within the language of rings, one can reason with it completely rigorously, without fixing a particular interpretation.  Nor does it mean they are rejecting platonism — even if there is one true mathematical world, there are certainly many rings in it.\r\n\r\nFor the full language of set theory, most mathematicians are much more wedded to a single default interpretation than in the case of rings.  So I think I agree with your point that sociologically, it might sometimes be a good idea for us to say “pseudointerval”, just to emphasise that we are considering a wider range of models than they may be used to.  However, if we choose instead to use the term “interval” analogously to how most mathematicians use “2” or “prime”, it is not wordplay; it is certainly not imprecise or incorrect; it is not even rejecting Platonism.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I think (though I’m not sure) that I’m something both of a Platonist and a relativist: I feel there may be one true world of mathematics, but I certainly do not think there is just one true way of reasoning about it!  A model of set theory (or any other foundation) is just a certain way of using the language of sets to describe a certain part of the true world of mathematics, looked at from a certain point of view.  There may be one true world of mathematics; but it does not contain a distinguished “true” model of set theory any more than it contains a distinguished “true” ring."
