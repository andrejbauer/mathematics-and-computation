message: "Dan,  \r\n\r\nI understand your formalist perspective, and don't have a problem with it.  I fully acknowledge that many forms of \"useless\" mathematics have found unexpected applicability after the fact. The freedom to explore the foundations of one's choosing, even if they aren't \"useful\", is a very good motivation for adopting the pluralist/relativist position being discussed.\r\n\r\nBut as Paul points out the formalist view competes in practice with what he is calling the \"Tower of Science\" that has THE mathematics as the bedrock of truth at its base.  Paul's suggestion that we abolish the monolith and become more aware of different <b>kinds</b> of mathematics needed by different \"customers\" seems like a positive step to me."
