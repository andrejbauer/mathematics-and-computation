(Not sure if this the the right reference.)\n\nA snappier definition of $\\aleph_1$ is the set of isomorphism classes of well-orderings of subsets of $\\Bbb N$. This is meaningful in Higher (maybe even Second) Order Logic but is obviously contingent on what predicates (subsets, relations) there are in the system.  How anybody could expect this to be universal, or even relevant, escapes me. I really don't think it belongs in the Tower of Science.\n\nPS I had even forgotten what $\\aleph$ looks like!"
