message: "There is an extreme form of relativism in which mathematics is just a game played by upper class schoolboys and yah-boo-sucks to any relevance to the rest of the community.\n\nIn contrast to this is the (fairly conventional) view that mathematics is part of the Tower of Science, with Physics, Chemistry, Biology and so on built on top of it.  I think this is the idea that Marc intended and which I feel Dan misrepresented.\n\nI discussed that view in my <a href=http://www.paultaylor.eu/ASD/foufct rel=\"nofollow\"><i>Foundations for Computable Topology</i></a>, with the analogy that the role of Foundations is that of an Architect who is commissioned to provide a building for a Client such as Analysis, who in turn has Customers such as Physics. Physics has certain requirements of the Analysis that it uses (maybe compactness of $[0,1]$) but does not care how those are implemented in the underlying Foundations.\n\nI was also thinking of the way in which the technology that has been used to provide components of our computers (screens and mass storage in particular) has completely changed during our careers, whilst remaining functionally equivalent.\n\nOn this analogy, I proposed in that essay that the Foundations should be designed <b>for</b> the mathematical discipline in question, starting from the Theorems that are characteristic of that discipline and used by its customers.\n\nThat proposal is <b>pluralist</b> in so far as it conceives of alternative ways of doing things, but still <b>monolithic</b> in so far as the disciplines together still have to support the Tower of Science.\n\nHere is another analogy that might topple this monolith.\n\nThis view of mathematics at the base of the tower is a bit like the classical view of Biology in which the Cell with a nucleus (<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryote rel=\"nofollow\">eukaryote</a>) is at the base of the tower of life (animals, plants and fungi).   However, we now know that eukaryotes only form about half of the total biomass, the remainder being <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prokaryote rel=\"nofollow\">prokaryotes</a> (bacteria and archaea), which have increasingly been found to break all of the old rules of biology.\n\nSo maybe classical mathematics at the base of the tower of classical science is like eukaryotic life and the strange type theories that computer scientists invent are the bacteria and archaea of mathematics.\n\n<i>There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.</i>, William Shakespeare, <i>Hamlet</i> (1.5.166-7)."
