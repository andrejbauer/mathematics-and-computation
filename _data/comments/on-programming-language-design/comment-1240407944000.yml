  Many of the criticisms leveraged against you <a
  href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/8brly/on_programming_language_design/c08szul"
  rel="nofollow">charge you with a bias against dynamic typing</a>, despite the
  fact that you're <a
  href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/8brly/on_programming_language_design/c09113t"
  rel="nofollow">merely trying to suggest more robust, orthogonal language
  features that have nothing in particular to do with typing</a>. I would
  suggest you edit your post to link to a safe dynamic language, <a
  href="http://code.google.com/p/pure-lang/" rel="nofollow">like Pure</a>, that
  includes these features to emphasize this point.
