message: "This is a reply to smallpaul, an angry person from Reddit. I have edited the post to make the idea with trees as subclasses more precise. Thank you for pointing out the lack of clarity in an insulting way.\r\n\r\nCommenting further on smallpaul's, uhm, \"review\" on Reddit (comment 21): recursion or something equivalent to it (loops, for example) is necessary in a programming language that is Turing complete, but NULL's are not. This is the reason I would not advocate elimination of recursion. Although I do think it would be beneficial to separate structural recursion (a.k.a. primitive recursion), which is guaranteed to terminate, from general recursion. I just don't know how to present it in a language without making it annoying."
