message: "I tend to agree with ken.\n\nYour article suggests to me a dillemma. If programmers are human and fallible, are not the designers who are also human just as capable of error? If what you seek is the one true language which can properly detect the intent of the programmer and protect them from their own mistakes then I would be amazed if you ever discover it. \n\nInstead, wouldn't a more natural solution be a language which gives the programmer the ability to modify it to suit the problem domain? To take you binary tree example, you chose languages which have primitives that can be used to emulate a solution, but their implementation wasn't built to understand those compositions. But what if there was a language that allowed you to construct a grammar and even a syntax that would operate on binary trees as you define them?\n\nSuch a language already exists and I believe it's called common lisp. The advantage of it is that whatever construct or operator or even syntax that the language designers failed to include can be added by the programmers as they explore their problem domain."
