message: "I disagree with your second point, that you need inductive data types in an object oriented language. Now, I LOVE inductive data types. But they are not necessary, once you have option types/maybe objects, (his first point).\r\n\r\nQuite clearly, a tree is an object with a root, left, and right: where left is an option type (Maybe Tree) and right is an option type (Maybe Tree).\r\n\r\nA full binary tree is an object with a root, and maybe children (Maybe Tree * Tree)"
