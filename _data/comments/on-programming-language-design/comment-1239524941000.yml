message: "\"... In fact, in order to speed up development (remember that the development time is expensive) the programmer should be told about errors without having to run the program and directing its execution to the place where the latest code change actually gets executed.\"\r\n\r\nAre you suggesting that the expense of code written in a strongly typed language can be reduced by cutting down test coverage? Well, I hope not. Especially in combination with the classic FUD-\"eye surgery\" example.\r\n\r\nI'm always dazzled by this kind of argument from static type advocates. It completely blinds out the nature of decision problems and creates the illusion that in recent time there was any progress happening towards a static type checking/static analysis system that converges \"number of compiler errors in the program\" and \"number of bugs in the program\" in any significant way. As soon as this doesn't happen (and imho it will never happen) your test coverage needs to be high, no matter what language you use.\r\n\r\nSo if your test coverage needs to be high anyway this degrades the extra-hassle of a static type checking compiler rather to a matter of taste than a matter of \"extra security\"."
