message: "I believe a dynamic language can have strong type checking.  The type checking can only be done in the context of whole program analysis, of course.  But we can leverage the fact developer knows what contexts they are developing for, and the complier should use those contexts to do the type checking analysis.  Unfortunately, few IDEs can consider the greater context of the executing program, and all are still in stone ages when it comes to using the optimizing compiler's type analysis.\n\nJavascript is a good example:  Any particular web page specifies the source Javascript, and the order it is executed.  In the context of a web page many of the simple Javascript type errors could be revealed by the compiler at compile time.  Having the compiler look at all pages (all contexts) in a website will allow it to conclude even more about the correctness of the Javascripts it contains.\n\nWhat I want is to combine languages simply so that languages serving as context for others can be declared succinctly.  I also want an IDE that accepts notifications from the optimizing compiler about type analysis."
