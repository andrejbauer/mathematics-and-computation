  Reply to Andrej: I certainly wouldn't argue too much, as I find inductive
  types the most natural thing in the world. But for an object-oriented
  language, full sum types are probably a bit of overkill: you start overlapping
  ways to do things, and then there is more for the programmer to get confused
  about. A possibly empty tree is a Maybe Tree, and you keep it to the one
  instance of sum typing.
