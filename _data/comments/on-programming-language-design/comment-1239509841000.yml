message: "&gt; But then we go back to the dichotomy: do you encourage reliable code through simplicity or do you create reliability through better compiler checks?\n\nWhy not both?\n\nVisual Basic will give you a compiler warning if you try to use a loop variable in a lambda. If you still want to do it you can, but at least you are warned."
