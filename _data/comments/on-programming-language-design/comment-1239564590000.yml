message: "Hi Andrej,\r\nIt seems I'm a little late to the party!\r\n\r\nI would like to thank you, sincerely, no smirking, for your considered reply to my original comment. This is one of the few posts I have seen that contains, but is not limited to, a discussion of a good dynamic language versus a good static language. \r\n\r\nI have not programmed in OCaml, Haskel, or ML - but I do see their examples on Rosetta Code which makes comparison easy (for example: http://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/Y_combinator#OCaml). I started my interest in Python in the mid 90's. I have personal experience of languages changing the way I think about problem solving after being exposed to the SKILL programming language (a lisp dialect), but also of how a language must be more 'complete' or 'well rounded' before it would be prudent to invest too much time in it.\r\n\r\nI think I should spend some time now investigating one of these functional, type-inferred, languages so I can more meaningfully join the debate.\r\n\r\nI did, welcome the addition of at least a syntax for adding type information to Python in this post: http://paddy3118.blogspot.com/2008/11/smearing-static-vs-dynamic-typing.html\r\nBut looking back, what I would take from my post was this:\r\n\r\n  \"You would need to think of static/dynamic as a continuum where instead of having languages bunched at either end, you would have a smearing out towards the middle.\"\r\n\r\n- Paddy."
