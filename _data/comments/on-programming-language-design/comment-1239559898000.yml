message: "Reply to Freek (33): Yes, memory consumption in Haskell can be quite unpredictable. This has always been one of the main criticisms of functional languages by John Reynolds, a pioneer of programming language theory.\n\nReply to smallpaul (35): Statically typed languages are my personal preference, _especially_ because of the kind of programming that I do. But I also write programs in dynamic languages and they're perfectly ok. In theory statically typed languages should always be a win, but practice shows that dyamically typed languages fare pretty well in the real world.\n\nI need to do some real work, so I'll stop replying now. Feel free to rant and so on. When I have a bit of time I'll implement Python as I would have done it: the constraint is that it has to be a dynamically typed language with lots of reflection and maximum flexibility. See you then."
