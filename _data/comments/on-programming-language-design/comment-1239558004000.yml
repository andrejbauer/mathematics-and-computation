message: "In this essay, the comments and the reddit comments you write, I hear three different things. I'd like you to please select one of the following and say which one represents your feelings. I'd also suggest that if you want to be clear in your writing that you stick to the one you select in subsequent articles and be clear about it.\r\n\r\nThe three statements are:\r\n\r\n1. I prefer static type checking languages. It's a personal preference.\r\n\r\n2. Static type checked languages are better. They are always better.\r\n\r\n3. Statically typed checked languages are better for CERTAIN KINDS OF PROJECTS AND PROGRAMMERS and dynamically typed languages are better for others.\r\n\r\nWith each post you shift between those three statements randomly, and in fact seem to switch around within this single post. At the beginning you say Python's design decisions are crazy and short-sighted. Then by the end you say that you find Python and Javascript better for certain tasks."
