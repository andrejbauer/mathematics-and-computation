message: "Jules: I've realized that dummy \"can't happen\" matching (with assert false) is\nbecoming rare in my OCaml code, as I tend to construct the data types in ways\nthat allow exhaustive matching without impossible branches, for instance by\nusing polymorphic variants instead of regular sum types or encodings like ['a\n* 'a list] for non-empty lists.\n\nAt any rate, even if you do end up using \"impossible\" matches, at least the\ntype system forces you to be explicit and to take a minute to think about\nwhether the branch can be reached or not."
