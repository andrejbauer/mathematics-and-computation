message: "<blockquote>Seth, but a Maybe Tree is not a tree, itâ€™s a Maybe. How do you expect to call tree methods on it?</blockquote>\r\nGive them to the maybe, which will forward it or not and wrap the return itself in a <code>Maybe</code>? (essentially implementing method-level lifting natively in the language) Might want a different operator for lifted method calls in order to discriminate between calls on <code>Maybe</code> and lifted calls on whatever is within <code>Maybe</code>."
