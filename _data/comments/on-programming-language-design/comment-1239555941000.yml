  I don't know Haskell at all, but I've always heard that it's not trivial to
  control the memory consumption of a Haskell program.  If this is true, and if
  I apply your theory that programmer's are "forgetful, lazy, and make every
  mistake imaginable", isn't that then a strong reason not to use Haskell?  Of
  course, if you know what you're doing, you probably can write Haskell programs
  that behave reasonably, memory-wise.  But then, if you know what you're doing,
  you can write very nice programs in C too.
