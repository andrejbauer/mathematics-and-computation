  Looking back at this, I guess I should say that my initial comment was about
  the only two points on which I disagree. (Not as strongly as my language
  suggests, though. Perhaps I was trying to be intentionally provocative to
  stimulate discussion?) That may give the impression that I disliked the post
  but, actually, I agree with pretty much all else, and I like it.
