message: "Have you looked at Scala? It addresses most of the issues you bring up. While it does have null (for compatibility with Java), the idiomatic alternative is the Option type, which is the equivalent to Haskell's Maybe. Case classes and pattern matching are a statically checked way to define and operate on datatypes. Definitions (vals) and variables (vars) are syntactic equals, but convention dictates that vals are preferred over vars. Scala's lambdas aren't broken in the way that Python's are. There's even a special syntax for lambdas. For-comprehensions are like Python's list comprehensions but on steroids (closer in expressiveness to Haskell's do-notation).\n\nScala is statically checked, it has a powerful type system, ok type inference, and it's fully compatible with Java. It basically takes Java, drags it halfway to Haskell, halfway to ML, and ends up looking a little like Python."
