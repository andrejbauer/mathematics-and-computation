  "We should design the language so that the default case is an immutable value.
  If the programmer wants a mutable value, he should say so explicitly. "


  Just wanted to say that another language that does exactly this is Rust.
  Example of variable declaration and initialisation:


  let x = 5;


  x there is immutable. If you want to make it mutable, you have to add the
  "mut" qualifier like so:


  let mut x = 5;
