If you choose dynamic typing you're done, and you're at a local maximum in the design space. If you choose static typing you have to design the type system very carefully. There is a whole spectrum between most safety and most flexibility.\r\n\r\nDynamic typing also allows you to solve problems like pickling/distribution in a more straightforward way."
