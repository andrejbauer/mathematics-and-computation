message: "Reply to Radu: You misunderstand me. I am not saying that programmers are stupid. I am saying they make mistakes because they are humans. They can't help it, no matter how smart they are. Most mistakes are really, really dumb, like mismatching the parenthesis, writing pritn insteand of print, forgetting to initialize a variable, etc. This has nothing to do with intelligence. It's about how our brains work. We're not robots.\r\n\r\nYou are suggesting that the programmer should think about his program hard. Yes, he should be thinking hard how to make his program good, not how to get rid of silly errors. That is just a waste of energy.\r\n\r\nThe tools I am suggesting are far from being blunt. Programming languages such as ML and Haskell are way, way more expressive than Java or Python."
