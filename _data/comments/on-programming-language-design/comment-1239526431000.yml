  Another way to represent empty, say, trees in Java would be to define an
  interface CanBeEmpty and derive trees from it. Method IsEmpty() is obvious and
  method Empty() would create an empty object (yes, a cast to the tree would be
  required; an inconvenience, but resolved at compile time). This does nor solve
  the fundamental problem of the value of an unitialized tree, but will help the
  programmer to build trees properly.
