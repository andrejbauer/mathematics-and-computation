  Haskell and ML have some really nice features the Maybe type is one of my
  favorite constructs too, but these languages will never be very useful until
  they have a real tool chain.  Anyone who has ever tried to find a bug in a
  large unfamiliar Haskell code base will know what I mean.  It is shockingly
  time consuming because the debugging tool chain is so primitive and things
  like dynamic linking only have experimental support.  The reality is that as
  fun and beautiful as it is to write in Haskell and as good as the language
  itself is, it is just not a terribly useful platform for everyday software
  development.  The ecosystem around it is not filled with people that are
  interested in getting things done.
