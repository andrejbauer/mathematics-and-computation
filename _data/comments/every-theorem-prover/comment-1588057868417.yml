message: "I am not sure what we will cover. We will start with proof assistants that are closer to the type-theoretic community, just because I know the scenery there better.\r\n\r\nPVS and ACL2 definitely belong to the \"established\" group, together with Coq, Agda, Lean, Isabelle etc. We will get to those eventually."
