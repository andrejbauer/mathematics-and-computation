message: "I am happy to believe you when you say you meant no offense but the fact that I wasn't the only one to complain should indicate that it is offensive and I hope you consider changing the name. By the way, I know nothing about Slovenia and only mentioned it to give you a taste of your own medicine.\r\n\r\nI am sure you have nothing to do with that, but the term \"tropical geometry\" also has its roots in a tasteless joke about Brazil, which now is too late to change."
