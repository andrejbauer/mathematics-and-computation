message: "@Felipe: I have had a couple of people express a similar sentiment. I am sorry you feel this way. You are taking it completely the wrong way, of course this has nothing to do with actual Brazil.\n\nIn the live talk I explained that \"Brazil\" came up in discussions at the Institute for Advanced Study as just a way of speaking that \"the proofs are sent somewhere far away\". We needed a name for \"somewhere\". For some reason Brazil caught on. I do not actually know who was the first to say \"Brazil\" but I am pretty sure it was not me.\n\nYou see, one can always take almost anything in bad faith. For instance, I could read your comment as saying \"look how Brazil is superior to Slovenia -- there are four Brazilians speaking at ICM in Seoul but no Slovenians -- Slovenia is such a backward country\". Is that how you meant your comment to be read? I am sure you have not, and I am not going to read it that way. So I ask you to take our naming the system \"Brazil\" as homage to Brazil. Would you like me to invent reasons why it is honorable to call it Brazil? Here is one: some very close mathematician friends of mine are from Brazil. Another one: I really love the mathematically minded stories \"Labyrinths\" by Borges (that's a joke!). Or maybe: the system is called after the movie \"Brazil\", not the country. I find such post festum invention of arguments pointless. I much prefer to be honest about it: we called it Brazil for the simple reason that our conversations went smoother if we could all imagine in an anthropomorphic way an external agent who would check proofs. I have no idea why we picked Brazil. That's that."
