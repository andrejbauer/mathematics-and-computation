If you hang around type theorists you will hear statements such as "type theory is better for formalization of mathematics" (than first-order logic and set theory).Â Some go further and claim that type theory is a better foundation for mathematics itself, not just for formalization. I agree, and my reasons have nothing to do with computation and constructive aspects of type theory.
