I am sitting at [CALCO 2013](http://coalg.org/calco13/) where I just gave my talk. I thnk I gave a decent talk, but I will let others be the judge of that. The CALCO organizers have provided a way to give anonymous feedback to the speakers about the quality of their talks. I think this is an excellent idea and it should be done more often. (I wish they put my talk on the list as well, even though I am not competing for the best talk prize, as I would love to hear some criticism.)  At least in my community the quality of talks could be much improved if people took the trouble of telling the speakers what they thought of their talks, honestly. For instance, I just got some feedback about my talk, namely that it was too slow. I appreciate that, really. I will start by admitting that I made my slides at the last moment. Well, I started last week but I finished them this morning. This seems to have become a habit of mine, and I hate it. But I just cannot decide what to put on the slides until the time is short. Perhaps I cannot get myself to write slides because I happen to think that they are a bad way of presenting material. A blackboard is much better in many contexts, even for computer science. Anyhow, now that I have told you that I am not perfect, I will allow myself to dispense some advice on how to improve slides. I will focus on the most prevalent defficiency, namely that **speakers put their entire talks on the slides**. And I will suggest how you can easily stop doing that. If at a typical talk in theoretical computer science (and I am sure the same holds for other areas) you cover your ears and just look at the slides, you will not miss much. Perhaps there will be technical details or minor remarks that you will not hear, but you could not process those anyway. **The slides are almost a complete transcript of the talk**. The upshot is that people do not _listen_ to talks but rather _read_ them off the slides. They read ahead of the speaker, and then they cannot bring themselves to listen to the speaker, because he is just saying what they read seconds ago.  This makes talks boring, so it is easy to open the laptop and do fun things, while still throwing a glance at the talk to see if the next slide is up yet. And when it appears, you read it quickly so you can continue writing your next blog post. I am doing that right now._ (Aha, new slide! Hmm, I don't get it ... he wil probably explain it ... Ok, I will just write the blog post). _I am a bit cynical, but only a bit. If the speaker is difficult to listen to, either because of a language barrier or because they are just yapping away, then they might be saved by the slides. Most probably however, the slides hurt the quality of the talk. People do not listen to the speaker because they can read faster than he can speak. When the speaker _does_ say something important the audience will miss it. Also, the speaker often just reads the slides and ends up staring at the wall instead of facing the audience. And so on, you know what I am talking about. Here are two counter-arguments defending the current practice of slide production, and I fully expect some more to appear in the comments:

1.  The slides should contain enough information to reconstruct the main points of the talk because they a record of the talk that can be looked at later. Many conferences systematically collect the slides and put them on web pages.
2.  The slides can be organized so that the items appear on the slide one by one. This restrains the audience from getting ahead of the speaker.

Regarding the first point, I agree.  I am going to suggest a solution which keeps all the benefits of recording talks through slides, but without ruining the talks. However,  let us make sure we get our priorities straight: if you go to the trouble of flying someplace just to give a 20 minute talk, shouldn't the talk be more important than the fact that your slides will appear on the internet? If recording yourself is so precious to you, why not [record a video of the talk](http://math.andrej.com/2011/12/01/video-lectures-as-screencasts/)? Regarding the second point, you should not display a slide which runs ahead of what you are saying, that much is true. But if you feel the need to restrain your audience you suffer from a basic misunderstanding about your relationship to the audience. Figure out how to keep the audience _with you_ instead of preventing them from running from you! Why are they tempted to get ahead? Are you saying irrelevant and boring things, or are you distracting them by providing visual information that is not relevant? Worry about what _you_ are doing wrong, not the audience. As an example, let me take a random slide from one of my talks: ![slide-example](http://math.andrej.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/slide-example.png) This is so afwul it is hard for me too look at! There is _too much stuff_ on the slide, visually speaking. And there is nothing I could say that is not already written. When I present this I should just stand in silence and wait for the audience to finish reading it, then move to the next slide. What _should_ the slide be like? You will not believe me, but _it should be empty. _None, and I mean _none_ of this should be on the slide. I should _tell_ the audience what we did. And when I try to do that, I will see that they will die of boredom if I go into all the details that are on the slide. The technical stuff about realizability, that will be obvious once I get into the details. And when I show examples it will be clear it is realizability over OCaml, so no need to explain that either. So the two important things are that we built a tool and that we used the realizability interpretation of constructive logic. Which means I can just stand there _without a slide_ and say:

> "We built a tool, called RZ, which takes as input a mathematical theory, and outputs the corresponding specification for a data structure imeplementing the theory. RZ uses realizability theory as supporting mathematical machinery to convert constructive mathematics to programs."

That feels much more satisfying, don't you think? I could even go on now and say a bit more, but probably not. I just saved myself 3 minutes of time to do something interesting in the talk. If I told you not to put on the slide the things you can just say out loud, that would not work. When you prepare for your talk you need to _record_ the plan of the talk. If you just planned the talk in your head and occasionally jot something down on the slides, you would end up with a faint memory of how you thought the talk should go. The magic solution is to use **slide notes**.  You know, the notes that you can put _off_ the slide and that only the speaker sees. Powerpoint, Keynote and LaTeX beamer all have them. And this is how you use slide notes:

1.  Make your slides as usual.
2.  Whenever you put _anything_ on a slide, ask yourself "could I just _say_ this out loud instead, or does it _really_ have to be on the slide"?
3.  If it is not absolutely necessary for the thing to be one the slide, take it off and stick it into slide notes. Sometimes you have to take off parts of the text, but formulas and pictures on the slide.

The result should
