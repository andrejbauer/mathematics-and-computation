For a while now I have been contemplating a series of seminars titled *"Every
proof assistant"* that would be devoted to all the different proof assistants
out there. Apart from the established ones
([Isabelle/HOL](https://isabelle.in.tum.de), [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr),
[Agda](https://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php),
[Lean](https://leanprover.github.io)), there are other interesting experimental
proof assistants, and some that are still under development, or just proofs of
concept. I would like to know more about them, and I suspect I am not the only
one.

Getting the authors of proof assistants to travel to Ljubljana and giving talks
at our [Foundations of mathematics and theoretical computer
science](https://www.fmf.uni-lj.si/si/obvestila/agregator/seminar-temelji/)
seminar has largely become impossible. But luckily research seminars world-wide
are rapidly moving online, and so is our Foundations seminar. I am therefore
delighted to announce the first "Every proof assistant" seminar:

> ##### Arend proof assistant
> **Time:** Thursday, April 30, 2020 from 19:00 to 20:00 (Central European Time)  
> **Location:** online at [Zoom ID 965 4439 5816](https://zoom.us/j/96544395816)  
> **Speaker:** [Valery Isaev](https://research.jetbrains.org/researchers/valis) (JetBrains research)
>
> **Abstract:** I will discuss Arend, a proof assistant developed at JetBrains
> Research. The aim of Arend is to provide a powerful system for formalization
> results in homotopy type theory and in ordinary mathematics. To achieve the
> latter goal, we prove a flexible class system with subtyping, universe
> polymorphism with a powerful level inference mechanism, quotient sets with a
> convenient pattern matching principles for them. We also recently implemented
> a tactic framework which can be used to automate routine proofs and implement
> various EDSLs. Homotopic features of Arend include built-in universes of
> finite homotopy level, higher inductive types, univalence, and path types in
> the style of cubical type theories. I will talk about these features and also
> about our plans to implement language extensions that can be used to simplify
> reasoning about various higher structures.

I have a couple more in the pipeline, so follow this blog, the [Foundations seminar announcements](https://www.fmf.uni-lj.si/si/obvestila/agregator/seminar-temelji/) or my Twitter account [@andrejbauer](https://twitter.com/andrejbauer).
