[_HERA_](http://www2.arnes.si/~abizja4/hera/) is an implementation of exact real arithmetic in Haskell using the approach by [Andrej Bauer](http://andrej.com/) and [Iztok Kavkler](http://www.fmf.uni-lj.si/~kavkler/), see [these](/2007/04/12/implementing-real-numbers-with-rz/) and [these slides](/2007/09/18/the-role-of-the-interval-domain-in-modern-exact-real-airthmetic/ "The Role of the Interval Domain in Modern Exact Real Arithmetic"). It uses the fast multiple precision floating point library [MPFR](http://www.mpfr.org/). Download [source](http://www2.arnes.si/~abizja4/hera/files/), and see [documentation](http://www2.arnes.si/~abizja4/hera/doc/index.html) and [examples](http://www2.arnes.si/~abizja4/hera/files/Demo.hs) of usage at my home page.

[_Note by Andrej:_ this is a guest post by Aleš Bizjak, a first-year student of mathematics at my department. I am very proud of the excellent work he did on his summer project.]
