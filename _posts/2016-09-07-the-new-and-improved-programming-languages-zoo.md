It is my pleasure to announce the new and improved [Programming languages Zoo](http://plzoo.andrej.com/index.html), a potpourri of miniature but fully functioning programming language implementations. The new zoo has a decent web site, it is nowÂ [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/andrejbauer/plzoo), and the source code was cleaned up. Many thanks to [Matija Pretnar](http://matija.pretnar.info/) for all the work.

The purpose of the zoo is to demonstrate design and implementation techniques, from dirty practical details to lofty theoretical considerations:

  * functional, declarative, object-oriented, and procedural languages
  * source code parsing with a parser generator
  * recording of source code positions
  * pretty-printing of values
  * interactive shell (REPL) and non-interactive file processing
  * untyped, statically and dynamically typed languages
  * type checking and type inference
  * subtyping, parametric polymorphism, and other kinds of type systems
  * eager and lazy evaluation strategies
  * recursive definitions
  * exceptions
  * interpreters and compilers
  * abstract machine

There is still a lot of room for improvement and new languages. Contributions are welcome!
