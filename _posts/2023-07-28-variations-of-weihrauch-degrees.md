I gave a talk “Variations on Weihrauch degrees” at [Computability in Europe
2023](https://www.viam.science.tsu.ge/cie2023/), which took place in Tbilisi, Georgia. The talk was a remote one,
unfortunately. I spoke about generalizations of Weihrauch degrees, a largely unexplored territory that seems to offer
many opportunities to explore new directions of research. I am unlikely to pursue them myself, but will gladly talk with
anyone who is interested in doing so.
