I have had the honor to lecture at the [Oregon Programming Language Summer School 2018](https://www.cs.uoregon.edu/research/summerschool/summer18/index.php) on the topic of algebraic effects and handlers. The notes, materials and the lectures are available online:

  * the GitHub repository with the [course material](https://github.com/OPLSS/introduction-to-algebraic-effects-and-handlers)
  * the [OPLSS lecture materials](https://www.cs.uoregon.edu/research/summerschool/summer18/topics.php), including notes and video recordings of the lectures

I gave four lectures which started with the mathematics of algebraic theories, explained how they can be used to model computational effects, how we make a programming language out of them, and how to program with handlers.
