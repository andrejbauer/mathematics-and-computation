After a short pause, our next talk in the series will be given by Jamie Vicary, who will
present a proof assistant in which the proofs are drawn!

> ##### Introducing homotopy.io: A proof assistant for geometrical higher category theory
>
> **Time:** Thursday, November 26, 2020 from 15:00 to 16:00 (Central European Time, UTC+1)  
> **Location:** online at [Zoom ID 989 0478 8985](https://zoom.us/j/98904788985)  
> **Speaker:** [Jamie Vicary](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jv258/) (University of Cambridge)  
> **Proof assistant:** [homotopy.io](https://homotopy.io/)
>
> **Abstract:**
>
> Weak higher categories can be difficult to work with algebraically,
> with the weak structure potentially leading to considerable bureaucracy.
> Conjecturally, every weak infty-category is equivalent to a
> "semistrict" one, in which unitors and associators are trivial; such a
> setting might reduce the burden of constructing large
> proofs. In this talk, I will present the proof assistant [homotopy.io](https://homotopy.io/),
> which allows direct construction of composites in a finitely-generated
> semistrict (infty,infty)-category. The terms of the proof assistant
> have a geometrical interpretation as string diagrams, and interaction
> with the proof assistant is entirely geometrical, by clicking and
> dragging with the mouse, completely unlike more traditional computer
> algebra systems. I will give an outline of the underlying theoretical
> foundations, and demonstrate use of the proof assistant to construct
> some nontrivial homotopies, rendered in 2d and 3d. I will close with
> some speculations about the possible interaction of such a system with
> more traditional type-theoretical approaches. (Joint work with Lukas
> Heidemann, Nick Hu and David Reutter.)
