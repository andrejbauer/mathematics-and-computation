**Abstract:** Computability theory, which investigates computable functions and computable sets, lies at the foundation of computer science. Its classical presentations usually involve a fair amount of G&ouml;del encodings which sometime obscure ingenious arguments. Consequently, there have been a number of presentations of computability theory that aimed to present the subject in an abstract and conceptually pleasing way. We build on two such approaches, Hyland&#8217;s effective topos and Richman&#8217;s formulation in Bishop-style constructive mathematics, and develop basic computability theory, starting from a few simple axioms. Because we want a theory that resembles ordinary mathematics as much as possible, we never speak of Turing machines and G&ouml;del encodings, but rather use familiar concepts from set theory and topology.

**Presented at:** Mathematical Foundations of Programming Semantics XXI, Birmingham, 2004 (invited talk).
