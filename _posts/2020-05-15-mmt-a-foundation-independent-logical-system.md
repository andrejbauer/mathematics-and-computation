I am happy to announce the next seminar in the "Every proof assistant" series.

> ##### MMT: A Foundation-Independent Logical System
>
> **Time:** Thursday, May 21, 2020 from 16:00 to 17:00 (Central European Summer Time, UTC+2)  
> **Location:** online at [Zoom ID 989 0478 8985](https://zoom.us/j/98904788985)  
> **Speaker:** [Florian Rabe](https://kwarc.info/people/frabe/) (University of Erlangen)  
> **Proof assistant:** [The MMT Language and System](https://uniformal.github.io/)
>
> **Abstract:** Logical frameworks are meta-logics for defining other logics. MMT follows this
> approach but abstracts even further: it avoids committing to any foundational features like function
> types or propositions. All MMT algorithms are parametric in a set of rules, which are self-contained
> objects plugged in by the language designer. That results in a framework general enough to develop
> many formal systems including other logical frameworks in it, enabling the rapidly prototyping of
> new language features.
> 
> Despite this high level of generality, it is possible to develop sophisticated results in MMT. The
> current release includes, e.g., parsing, type reconstruction, module system, IDE-style editor, and
> interactive library browser. MMT is systematically designed to be extensible, providing multiple
> APIs and plugin interfaces, and thus provides a versatile infrastructure for system development and
> integration.
> 
> This talk gives an overview of the current state of MMT and its future challenges. Examples are
> drawn from the LATIN project, a long-running project of building a modular, highly inter-related
> suite of formalizations of logics and related formal systems.
>
> After the talk, the video recording will be made available.
