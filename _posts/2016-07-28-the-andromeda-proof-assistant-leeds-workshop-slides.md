I am about to give an invited talk at the  [Workshop on Categorical Logic and Univalent Foundations 2016](http://www.hott16.leeds.ac.uk) in Leeds, UK. It's a charming workshop that I am enjoing a great deal. Here are the slides of my talk, with speaker notes, as well as the Andromeda examples that I am planning to cover.
