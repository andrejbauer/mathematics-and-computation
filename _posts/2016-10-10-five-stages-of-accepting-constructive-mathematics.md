In 2013 I gave a talk about constructive mathematics [&#8220;Five stages of accepting constructive mathematics&#8221; (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21qPOReu4FI) at the Institute for Advanced Study. I turned the talk into a paper, polished it up a bit, added things here and there, and finally it has now been published in the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society. It is not quite a survey paper, but it is not very technical either. I hope you will enjoy reading it.
