This week shall witness a performance by Conor McBride.

> ##### Epigram 2: Autopsy, Obituary, Apology
>
> **Time:** Thursday, June 11, 2020 from 16:00 to 17:00 (Central European Summer Time, UTC+2)  
> **Location:** online at [Zoom ID 989 0478 8985](https://zoom.us/j/98904788985)  
> **Speaker:** [Conor McBride](http://strictlypositive.org) (University of Strathclyde)  
> **Proof assistant:** [Epigram 2](https://github.com/mietek/epigram2)
>
> **Abstract:**
> "A good pilot is one with the same number of take-offs and landings."
> runs the old joke, which makes me a very bad pilot indeed. The Epigram
> 2 project was repeatedly restarted several times in the late 2000s and
> never even reached cruising altitude. This talk is absolutely not an
> attempt to persuade you to start using it. Rather, it is an
> exploration of the ideas which drove it: proof irrelevant
> observational equality, first class datatype descriptions, nontrivial
> equational theories for neutral terms. We may yet live to see such
> things. Although the programming language elaborator never happened,
> the underlying proof engine was accessible via an imperative interface
> called "Cochon": we did manage some interesting constructions, at
> least one of which I can walk through. I'll also explore the reasons,
> human and technological, why the thing did not survive the long dark.
