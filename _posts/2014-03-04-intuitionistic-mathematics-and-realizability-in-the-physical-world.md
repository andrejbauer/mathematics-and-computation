This is a draft version of my contribution to [&#8220;A Computable Universe: Understanding and Exploring Nature as Computation&#8221;](http://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/8306), edited by [Hector Zenil](http://www.mathrix.org/zenil/). Consider it a teaser for the rest of the book, which contains papers by an impressive list of authors.

<strong style="line-height: 1.5;">Abstract:</strong> <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Intuitionistic mathematics perceives subtle variations in meaning where classical mathematics asserts equivalence, and permits geometrically and computationally motivated axioms that classical mathematics prohibits. It is therefore well-suited as a logical foundation on which questions about computability in the real world are studied. The realizability interpretation explains the computational content of intuitionistic mathematics, and relates it to classical models of computation, as well as to more speculative ones that push the laws of physics to their limits. Through the realizability interpretation Brouwerian continuity principles and Markovian computability axioms become statements about the computational nature of the physical world.</span>
