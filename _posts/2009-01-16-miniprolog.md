I have aded to the [PL Zoo](http://andrej.com/plzoo/) a mini prolog interpreter. It really is minimalistic, as it only handles pure Horn clauses. There is no arithmetic, lists, cuts, or disjunctions. Nevertheless, it ought to be possible to write a miniml interpreter in it&#8230; If anyone does it, please send me the code!
