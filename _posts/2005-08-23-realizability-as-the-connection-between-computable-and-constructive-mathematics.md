**Abstract:**  
These are lecture notes for a tutorial seminar which I gave at a satellite seminar of [Computability and Complexity in Analysis 2005](http://cca-net.de/cca2005/) in Kyoto. The main message of the notes is that _computable mathematics is the realizability interpretation of constructive mathematics_. The presentation is targeted at an audience which is familiar with computable mathematics but less so with constructive mathematics, category theory or realizability theory. 

**Note:** I have revised the original version from August 23, 2005 and corrected the horrible error at the beginning of Section 2. I would appreciate reports on other mistakes that you find in these notes.
