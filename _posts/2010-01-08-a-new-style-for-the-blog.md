It was time I changed the old blog style to something a bit more modern. I hope you like it.

Now I just have to figure out how to port 60 blog posts from [ASCIIMathML](http://www1.chapman.edu/~jipsen/mathml/asciimath.html) notation to something a bit friendlier that can use MathML but does not require it. What is out there? I know about [jsMath](http://www.math.union.edu/~dpvc/jsMath/). I am open to suggestions.
