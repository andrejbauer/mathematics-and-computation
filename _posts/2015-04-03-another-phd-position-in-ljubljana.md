It is my pleasure to announce a second PhD position in Ljubljana!

A position is available for a PhD student at the University of Ljubljana in the general research area of modelling and reasoning about computational effects. The precise topic is somewhat flexible, and will be decided in discussion with the student. The PhD will be supervised by [Alex Simpson](https://www.fmf.uni-lj.si/si/imenik/32646/) who is Professor of Computer Science at the [Faculty of Mathematics and Physics](https://www.fmf.uni-lj.si/si/).

The position will be funded by the Effmath project (see [project description](http://math.andrej.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/description.pdf)). Full tuition & stipend will be provided.

The candidate should have a master's (or equivalent) degree in either mathematics or computer science, with background knowledge relevant to the project area. The student will officially enrol in October 2015 at the University of Ljubljana. No knowledge of the Slovene language is required.

The candidates should contact <a href="mailto:Alex.Simpson@fmf.uni-lj.si" target="_blank">Alex.Simpson@fmf.uni-lj.si</a> by email as soon as possible. Please include a short CV and a statement of interest.
