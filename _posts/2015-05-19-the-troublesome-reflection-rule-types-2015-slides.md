Here are the slides of my [TYPES 2015](http://cs.ioc.ee/types15/) talk &#8220;The troublesome reflection rule&#8221; with fairly detailed presenter notes. The meeting is  taking place in Tallinn, Estonia – a very cool country in many senses (it&#8217;s not quite spring yet even though we&#8217;re in the second half of May, and it&#8217;s the country that gave us Skype).
