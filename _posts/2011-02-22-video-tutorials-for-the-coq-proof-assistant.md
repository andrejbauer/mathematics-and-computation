Next week I am going to a meeting where I am supposed to give a tutorial on the Coq proof assistant. Inspired by the [Catsters](http://www.youtube.com/user/TheCatsters), I decided to prepare the material in the form of screencasts. You can find the first few tutorials on Youtube in my &#8220;[Coq tutorials](http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=DD40A96C2ED54E99)&#8221; playlist. So far I have:

  * [Obtaining and installing the Coq proof assistant](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COe0VTNF2EA)
  * [How to use CoqIDE](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sk8hPWAMSw)
  * [How to use Coq with Proof General](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6zqLJQCnzo)
  * [A first proof with Coq (Frobenius rule)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z861PoZPGqk)
  * [The dual Frobenius rule, part 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZRAFKIv6Js)
  * [The dual Frobenius rule, part 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCsUZhx9OHg)
  * [Currying and uncurrying, part 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2Q5GJhgsjA)
  * [Currying and uncurrying, part 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SjM5f3GkV0)

You should turn on the high quality HD stream when you watch these. Feedback is welcome (and easy to provide on Youtube). I find it very, very difficult to listen to my own voice. I hope to have many more lectures soon, but I am starting to feel out of my depth, so if anyone wants to help they are welcome!

<!--more-->I am making screencasts with 

[Screenium](http://www.syniumsoftware.com/screenium/) on my Mac, which is just one of many available options. Preparation of a screencast takes less time than preparation of equivalent written notes or slides, as long as one is not obsessed with making everything perfect. In fact, I think it is important _not_ to make tutorials perfect. In a screencast the viewer can see how I make mistakes and, more importantly, how I discover and fix them. It still takes me two or three takes before I am happy with a screencast, but all in all the process is becoming more streamlined with each next tutorial.

I have learnt a couple of tricks. The &#8220;pause&#8221; button is my friend when the phone rings or I need to think for a moment what to say next. It takes less time to start over than to try to edit out mistakes afterwards. A screen cast must be _short._ There must be a central message, but often I find it convenient to explain &#8220;on the side&#8221; various details which do not easily fit anywhere.

Somehow the whole process feels organic. There is less global planning than in teaching a course, but some planning is still needed. There are non-traditional ways of organizing tutorials into playlists. For example, other people can combine screencasts from various sources and create their own tracks. I think there is a lot of potential.

Screencasts are ok for computer-sciency themes, such as Coq and programming, but for real math, I will have to make videos of handwriting. The Catsters stand in front of a blackboard in their videos, but I would like to try pencil and paper with our departmental document camera. We will see how that goes.
