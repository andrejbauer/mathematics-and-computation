Egbert Rijke successfully defended his master thesis in Utrecht a couple of weeks ago. He [published it on the _Homotopy type theory_ blog](http://homotopytypetheory.org/2012/08/18/a-master-thesis-on-homotopy-type-theory/) (here is [a direct link to the PDF file (revised)](http://hottheory.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/hott2.pdf)). The thesis is well written and it contains several new results, but most importantly, it is a gentle yet non-trivial introduction to homotopy type theory. If you are interested in the topic but do not know where to start, Egbert's thesis might be perfect for you. As far as I know it is the first substantial piece of text written _in_Â (informal) homotopy type theory.

What I find most amazing about the work is that Egbert does not have to pretend to be a homotopy type theorist, like us old folks. His first contact with type theory _was_ homotopy type theory, which impressed on his mind a new kind of geometric intuition about $\Pi$'s, $\Sigma$'s and $\mathrm{Id}$'s. If we perform enough such experiments on young bright students, strange things will happen.
