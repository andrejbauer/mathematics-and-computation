At [TYPES 2023](https://types2023.webs.upv.es) I had the honor of giving an invited talk “On Isomorphism Invariance and Isomorphism Reflection in Type Theory” in which I discussed isomorphism reflection, which states that isomorphic types are judgementally equal. This strange principle is consistent, and it validates some fairly strange type-theoretic statements.

Here are **[the slides with speaker notes](/asset/data/TYPES2023-Isomoprhism-invariance-and-reflection.pdf)** and **[the video recording](https://media.upv.es/#/portal/video/4fa0db80-354d-11ee-8317-3dc1d7f6252c)** of the talk.
