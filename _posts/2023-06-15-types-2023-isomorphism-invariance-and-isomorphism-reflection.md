At [TYPES 2023](https://types2023.webs.upv.es) I had the honor of giving an invited talk “On Isomorphism Invariance and Isomorphism Reflection in Type Theory” in which I discussed isomorphism reflection, which states that isomorphic types are judgementally equal. This strange principle is consistent, and it validates some fairly strange type-theoretic statements.

Here are [the slides with speaker notes](/asset/data/TYPES2023-Isomoprhism-invariance-and-reflection.pdf).
