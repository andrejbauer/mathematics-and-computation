I am about to give an invited talk at the [Computability and Complexity in Analysis 2016](http://cca-net.de/cca2016/) conference (yes, I am in the south of Portugal, surrounded by loud English tourists, but we _are_ working here, in a basement no less). Here are the slides, with extensive speaker notes, comment and questions are welcome.
