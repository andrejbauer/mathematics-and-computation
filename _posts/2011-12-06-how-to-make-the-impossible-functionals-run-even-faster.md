A talk given at [“Mathematics, Algorithms and Proofs 2011”](http://www.lorentzcenter.nl/lc/web/2011/467/info.php3?wsid=467) at the Lorentz Center in Leiden, the Netherlands. I explain how to use computational effects to speed up [Martin Escardo's impossible functionals](http://math.andrej.com/2007/09/28/seemingly-impossible-functional-programs/).
