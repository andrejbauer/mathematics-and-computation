This week the speaker will be Jon Sterling, and we are getting two proof assistants for the price of one!

> ##### `redtt` and the future of Cartesian cubical type theory
>
> **Time:** Thursday, June 4, 2020 from 16:00 to 17:00 (Central European Summer Time, UTC+2)  
> **Location:** online at [Zoom ID 989 0478 8985](https://zoom.us/j/98904788985)  
> **Speaker:** [Jon Sterling](https://www.jonmsterling.com) (Carnegie Mellon University)  
> **Proof assistant:** [redtt](https://github.com/RedPRL/redtt) and [cooltt](https://github.com/RedPRL/cooltt)
>
> **Abstract:**
> `redtt` is an interactive proof assistant for Cartesian cubical type theory, a version of
> Martin-Löf type theory featuring computational versions of function extensionality, higher
> inductive types, and univalence. Building on ideas from Epigram, Agda, and Idris, `redtt`
> introduces a new cubical take on interactive proof development with holes. We will first
> introduce the basics of cubical type theory and then dive into an interactive
> demonstration of `redtt`’s features and its mathematical library.
>
> After this we will catch a first public glimpse of the future of `redtt`, a new prototype
> that our team is building currently code-named “`cooltt`”: `cooltt` introduces syntax to
> split on disjunctions of cofibrations in arbitrary positions, implementing the full
> definitional eta law for disjunction. While `cooltt` is still in the early stages, it
> already has full support for univalence and cubical interactive proof development.
