Proof assistant communities have grown quite a bit lately. They have active Zulip chats: [Lean](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/), [Coq](https://coq.zulipchat.com/), [Agda](https://agda.zulipchat.com/), [Isabelle](https://isabelle.zulipchat.com/). These are good for discussions, but less so for knowledge accumulation and organization, and are not indexed by the search engines.

I have therefore created a [proposal for a new “Proof assistants”](https://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/126242/proof-assistants?referrer=YjczN2ZjMzMyYWRkYjYwOTMzMzJhMjRmZDNiZDJkZGQ1ZGE4MzFiZWQ3YzRlMjYzMzdiMTMxZTBkOTg1ZWNkMdt2-If5yCiayS9kTjQT0iElh8l0mRnZ3CnkNXRmWJGq0) StackExchange site. I believe that such a site would complement very well various Zulips dedicated to specific proof assistants. If you favor the idea, please support it by visiting the proposal and

* becoming a follower (you have to be a registered user with a verified email account),
* asking sample questions, and
* upvoting good sample questions.
 
To pass the first stage, we need 60 followers and 40 questions with at least 10 votes to proceed to the next stage.
