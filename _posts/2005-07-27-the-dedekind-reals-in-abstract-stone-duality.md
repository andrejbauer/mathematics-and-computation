With [Paul Taylor](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~pt/).

**Abstract:** Abstract Stone Duality (ASD) is an approach to topology that provides an abstract and conceptually satisfying account of topological spaces. The calculus of ASD reveals the computational content of various topological notions and suggests how to compute with them. The distinguishing feature of ASD is a direct axiomatisation in terms of spaces and maps, which does not rely on an underlying set-theoretic or topos-theoretic foundation.

This paper makes the first step in real analysis within ASD, namely the construction of the real line using two-sided Dedekind cuts. Compactness and overtness of the closed interval are proved, and the arithmetic operations are defined. The ASD calculus gives programs for computing the arithmetic operations and the quantifiers that express compactness and overtness.

As the paper aims to be a self-contained introduction to ASD for those interested in constructive and computable topology and analysis, it includes a rapid survey of the ASD calculus. The foundational background to the calculus was covered in detail in earlier work. 

Further topics in real analysis within ASD, such as the Intermediate Value Theorem, are presented in [a separate paper](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~pt/ASD/#ASD/lamcra) by Paul Taylor which builds on this one.

To be presented at [Computability and Complexity in Analysis 2005](http://cca-net.de/cca2005), Kyoto, Japan.
