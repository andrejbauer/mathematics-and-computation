We shall finish the semester with a "Every proof assistant" talk by William Bowman.
Note that we start an hour later than usual, at 17:00 UTC+2.

> ##### Cur: Designing a less devious proof assistant
>
> **Time:** Thursday, June 25, 2020 from 17:00 to 18:00 (Central European Summer Time, UTC+2)  
> **Location:** online at [Zoom ID 989 0478 8985](https://zoom.us/j/98904788985)  
> **Speaker:** [William J. Bowman](https://williamjbowman.com) (University of British Columbia)  
> **Proof assistant:** [Cur](https://github.com/wilbowma/cur)
>
> **Abstract:**
>
> Dijkstra said that our tools can have a profound and devious influence on our thinking. I
> find this especially true of modern proof assistants, with "devious" out-weighing
> "profound". Cur is an experiment in design that aims to be less devious. The design
> emphasizes language extension, syntax manipulation, and DSL construction and integration.
> This enables the user to be in charge of how they think, rather than requiring the user to
> contort their thinking to that of the proof assistant. In this talk, my goal is to
> convince you that you want similar capabilities in a proof assistant, and explain and
> demonstrate Cur's attempt at solving the problem.
