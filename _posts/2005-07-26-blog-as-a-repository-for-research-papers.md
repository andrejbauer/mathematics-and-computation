I have created a blog category in which I will stick all my research papers. The idea is to allow people to comment on the papers and have an opportunity for discussion. There are some obvious advantages to this, such as: bug reports, opinions, references to related and relevant topics, a paper and a discussion about it are found in the same place, etc. Right now I do not see any obvious drawbacks, so I hope it will turn out to be a good idea.
