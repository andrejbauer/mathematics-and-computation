This is just to let you know that I moved the blog to a new server, which will be up even when I am away on holidays. The new url is [http://math.andrej.com/](http://math.andrej.com). If someone knows how to tell all those RSS feeds that seem to be accessing my blog that they should go to the new address, please let me know. Right now I have redirects set up, but that is not an acceptable long-term solution.
