[Bob Harper](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/) of CMU, has recently started a blog, called [Existential Type](http://existentialtype.wordpress.com/), about programming languages. He is a leading expert in Programming Languages. I remember being deeply inspired the first time I heard him talk. I was an incoming graduate student at CMU and he presented what the programming languages people at CMU did. His posts are fun to read, unreserved and very educational. Highly recommended!
