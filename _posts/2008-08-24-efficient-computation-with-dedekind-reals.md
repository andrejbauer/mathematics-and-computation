Two versions of this talk were given at [Computability and complexity in analysis 2008](http://cca-net.de/cca2008/) and at [Mathematics, Algorithms and Proofs 2008](http://cdsagenda5.ictp.trieste.it/full_display.php?smr=0&ida=a07167).

Joint work with [Paul Taylor](http://www.paultaylor.eu/).

**Abstract:** Cauchy's construction of reals as sequences of rational approximations is the theoretical basis for a number of implementations of exact real numbers, while Dedekind's construction of reals as cuts has inspired fewer useful computational ideas. Nevertheless, we can see the computational content of Dedekind reals by constructing them within [Abstract Stone Duality](http://www.paultaylor.eu/ASD/) (ASD), a computationally meaningful calculus for topology. This provides the theoretical background for a novel way of computing with real numbers in the style of logic programming. Real numbers are defined in terms of (lower and upper) Dedekind cuts, while programs are expressed as statements about real numbers in the language of ASD. By adapting Newton's method to interval arithmetic we can make the computations as efficient as those based on Cauchy reals.
