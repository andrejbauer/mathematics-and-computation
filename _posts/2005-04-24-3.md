I recently stumbled upon a [blog on machine learning](http://hunch.net) by a good friend of mine, John Langford. The blog has gathered together a community of people who discuss various topics (not limited strictly to machine learning). Naturally I wanted to have a blog, too. 

I devote a lot of my time to thinking about the relationship between mathematics and computation. There are two sides of this, which can be expressed by a the slogan _“Computable mathematics and mathematics of computation”._ Computable mathematics is about how to do mathematics with computers, while mathematics of computation is about mathematics that describes properties of computation in a mathematical, abstract way. 

If this is a subject that interests you, I invite you to join me.
