**Abstract:** In this paper I compare two well studied approaches to topological semantics&mdash;the domain-theoretic approach, exemplified by the category of countably based equilogical spaces, \`omega\`Equ, and Type Two Effectivity, exemplified by the category of Baire space representations, Rep(B). These two categories are both locally cartesian closed extensions of countably based \`T_0\`-spaces. A natural question to ask is how they are related.

First, we show that Rep(B) is equivalent to a full coreflective subcategory of \`omega\`Equ, consisting of the so-called \`0\`-equilogical spaces. This establishes a pair of adjoint functors between Rep(B) and \`omega\`Equ. The inclusion of Rep(B) in \`omega\`Equ and its coreflection have many desirable properties, but they do not preserve exponentials in general. This means that the cartesian closed structures of Rep(B) and \`omega\`Equ are essentially different. However, in a second comparison we show that Rep(B) and \`omega\`Equ do share a common cartesian closed subcategory that contains all countably based \`T\_0\`-spaces. Therefore, the domain-theoretic approach and TTE yield equivalent topological semantics of computation for all higher-order types over countably based \`T\_0\`-spaces. We consider several examples involving the natural numbers and the real numbers to demonstrate how these comparisons make it possible to transfer results from one setting to another.
