This is an advertisement for two great meetings we are organizing in Ljubljana from June 15 to June 20, 2012:

  * [Fourth workshop on formal topology](http://4wft.fmf.uni-lj.si/) (June 15—19)
  * [Workshop on Higher Dimensional Algebra, Categories and Types](http://4wft.fmf.uni-lj.si/hdact/) (June 20)

There are many reasons why you should come: Ljubljana is lovely in June, with many cafes and restaurants on the Ljubljanica river bank, we have a very i[nteresting programme](http://4wft.fmf.uni-lj.si/programme/), and when will you next be able to attend a meeting in which the keynote speakers are Per Martin-Löf, Ieke Moerdijk and Vladimir Voevodsky? Not to mention that the schedule is fairly light, everything is within walking distance, and we are organizing dinners at some excellent restaurants.

If you decide to come, make sure to book a hotel early and [register](http://4wft.fmf.uni-lj.si/registration/) today!
