This semester my colleague [Jaka Smrekar](https://www.fmf.uni-lj.si/~smrekar/) and I are teaching a graduate course on homotopy theory and homotopy type theory. The first part was taught by Jaka and was a nice review of classical homotopy theory leading up to Quillen model categories. In the second part I am covering basic homotopy type theory.

The course materials are available at the GitHub repository [`homotopy-type-theory-course`](https://github.com/andrejbauer/homotopy-type-theory-course). The homotopy type theory lectures are also [recorded on video](https://vimeo.com/channels/1457250).
