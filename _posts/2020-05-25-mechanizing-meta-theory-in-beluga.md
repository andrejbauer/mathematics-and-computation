We are marching on with the Every proof assistant series!

> ##### Mechanizing Meta-Theory in Beluga
> 
> **Time:** Thursday, May 28, 2020 from 16:00 to 17:00 (Central European Summer Time, UTC+2)  
> **Location:** online at [Zoom ID 989 0478 8985](https://zoom.us/j/98904788985)  
> **Speaker:** [Brigitte Pientka](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~bpientka/) (McGill University)  
> **Proof assistant:** [Beluga](http://complogic.cs.mcgill.ca/beluga/)
> 
> **Abstract:** Mechanizing formal systems, given via axioms and inference rules, together
> with proofs about them plays an important role in establishing trust in formal
> developments. In this talk, I will survey the proof environment Beluga. To specify formal
> systems and represent derivations within them, Beluga relies on the logical framework LF;
> to reason about formal systems, Beluga provides a dependently typed functional language
> for implementing (co)inductive proofs about derivation trees as (co)recursive functions
> following the Curry-Howard isomorphism. Key to this approach is the ability to model
> derivation trees that depend on a context of assumptions using a generalization of the
> logical framework LF, i.e. contextual LF which supports first-class contexts and
> simultaneous substitutions.
>
> Our experience demonstrated that Beluga enables direct and compact
> mechanizations of the meta-theory of formal systems, in particular programming
> languages and logics.
>
> The talk will be recorded and published on-line.
