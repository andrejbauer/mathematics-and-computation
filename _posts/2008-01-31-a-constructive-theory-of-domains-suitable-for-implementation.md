With [Iztok Kavkler](http://www.fmf.uni-lj.si/~kavkler/).

**Abstract:** We formulate a predicative, constructive theory of continuous domains whose realizability interpretation gives a practical implementation of continuous Ï‰-chain complete posets and continuous maps between them. We apply the theory to implementation of the interval domain and exact real numbers.
