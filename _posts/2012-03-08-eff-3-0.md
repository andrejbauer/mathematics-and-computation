[Matija](http://matija.pretnar.info/) and I are pleased to announce a new major release of the [eff programming language](/eff/).

In the last year or so eff has matured considerably:

  * It now looks and feels like [OCaml](http://caml.inria.fr/), so you won&#8217;t have to learn yet another syntax.
  * It has static typing with parametric polymorphism and type inference.
  * Eff now clearly separates three basic concepts: effect types, effect instances, and handlers.
  * How eff works is explained in our paper on [Programming with Algebraic Effects and Handlers](/2012/03/08/programming-with-algebraic-effects-and-handlers/).
  * We moved the [source code to GitHub](https://github.com/matijapretnar/eff), so go ahead and fork it!
