# RZ

**RZ** is a tool for automatic generation of program specifications from definitions of mathematical theories. It was written by [Chris Stone](http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~stone/) and [Andrej Bauer](http://andrej.com). The purpose of RZ is to help programmers and mathematicians design data structures which properly implement mathematical structures (algebras, real numbers, Hilbert spaces, etc.)
